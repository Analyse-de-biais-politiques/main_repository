,vox.com,8.528465,Lean Left,"We polled 1,060 Americans about abortion. This is what they got wrong.","Most Americans — Democrats and Republicans, men and women, pro-choice and pro-life — all share a belief about **abortion**: that it's rare.
Twenty-seven percent of Americans think fewer than 10 percent of women will have an **abortion** in their lifetime; 51 percent say it’s fewer than 20 percent, a new Vox poll of 1,060 registered voters conducted by communications firm Perry/Undem shows.
This turns out to be a significant underestimate. The best data available suggests that about 25 to 30 percent of American women will terminate a pregnancy at some point in their lives.
Americans also overestimate the safety risks for women who have abortions, our poll shows. Most people think **abortion** is either ""less safe"" or ""about as safe"" for women as giving birth. But that's not true. In actuality, bearing a child causes more serious complications and deaths for mothers than **abortion** does.
**Abortion** is a common medical procedure. There are hundreds of thousands more abortions each year in the US than either appendectomies or hysterectomies.
**Abortion** is also safe for women who have the procedure. There are twice as many complications associated with wisdom teeth removal as with **abortion**. Complications for both procedures tend to be relatively minor (for **abortion**, a common complication is cramping, and for wisdom teeth it's inflammation).
These misperceptions aren't just unfortunate psychological quirks; they work together to contribute to a view of **abortion** as being infrequent and risky for the women who have one. That ultimately shapes the way we regulate **abortion** in the United States and how we judge which restrictions ought to stand.
Our misperception of **abortion** as rare means that we think few women are affected by new **abortion** laws and regulations, when many are.
And our misperception of **abortion** as dangerous for women who have them allows more laws that reduce **abortion** access — like Texas's new restrictions — under the guise of improving the safety of an already safe medical procedure.
Americans tend to think that **abortion** is rare — especially well-educated, high-income Americans
Social science shows that we tend to underestimate the frequency of experiences we hear less about. And that makes sense; if all your neighbors are talking about crime, or you heard about it a lot on the nightly news, it would be fair to start wondering whether a local crime wave has occurred. We overestimate things like teen pregnancy, perhaps because there are entire reality shows devoted to the subject.
""We overestimate the amount of people who get killed by gunshots and underestimate the amount killed by heart attacks, because we see a lot more news about gunshots,"" says Eric Beasley, a sociologist who studies risk perception at Michigan State University. ""**Abortion** is hidden and not talked about, so nobody knows how often it happens.""
Our poll finds groups of Americans that have the highest **abortion** rates — low-income and less educated women — tend to more accurately guess the prevalence of **abortion**. Demographics with lower **abortion** rates, meanwhile, tend to have less accurate guesses.
More educated and higher-income Americans are especially likely to believe that **abortion** is rare.
For example, 54 percent of Americans without a college degree underestimate **abortion** rates, compared with 70 percent of those with graduate degrees. And 51 percent of those earning less than $50,000 underestimate the frequency of **abortion**, compared with 69 percent of those earning more than $175,000.
The split happens when you look at gender, too. Women would near certainly have more experience with **abortion** than men. Our poll shows that 67 percent of men underestimate the frequency of **abortion**, compared with 57 percent of women.
Also, knowing someone who had an **abortion** increases the odds that that person will accurately approximate the overall **abortion** rate. Those who say they have discussed the experience of another's **abortion** are 9 percentage points less likely to underestimate the **abortion** rate (55 percent versus 64 percent).
Americans overestimate how dangerous **abortion** is for women undergoing the procedure
Studies repeatedly show that **abortion** rarely results in medical complications and almost never causes the mother to die. Of the 730,322 women who had abortions in the United States 2011, two died. That's a rate of 0.27 deaths for every 100,000 women having an **abortion**. The rate for childbirth in America is 17.8 deaths for every 100,000 women giving birth.
But our perception of abortion's safety is different — and influenced by our views on **abortion** itself.
Overall, four out of five poll respondents (80 percent) said that childbirth was safer or ""about as safe"" as **abortion**.
This was especially true among respondents who identify as pro-life; 88 percent of that group estimated **abortion** to be equally safe or less safe than childbirth. That could reflect moral beliefs about **abortion**. If you believe **abortion** is wrong, that might lead you to overestimate how dangerous it is for the women who undergo it.
More interesting, though, is that **abortion** rights supporters — people in our poll who identify as pro-choice — also perceive **abortion** as dangerous. They presumably don't have the same moral objections to terminating a pregnancy. But 67 percent of pro-choice respondents incorrectly estimated **abortion** to be riskier or just as risky as giving birth.
**Abortion** tends to happen separately from the rest of the health care system, housed in its own clinics, because doctors and hospitals often don't want to deal with the political backlash and specific regulations that can come with providing that service.
A third of our poll respondents said they weren't sure whether doctors who performed abortions had to maintain medical licenses like other doctors. (The answer is yes, **abortion** providers are indeed required to maintain medical licenses.)
These misperceptions about dangers and training help set the stage for the most recent wave of **abortion** restrictions that impose additional health regulations on clinics. Most notable of these is Texas's law, which the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on this week, and which requires all **abortion** clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers.
Where false beliefs on **abortion** come from

It's not totally clear why our perceptions of **abortion** skew toward high levels of danger and risk. It could relate to the fact that **abortion** rarely gets discussed, so it seems shadowy and unknown. Or an earlier era of unsafe and unregulated **abortion** may stick in our minds, from the 1950s and '60s and earlier.
""It might be a holdover from talking about illegal abortions, which are unsafe,"" says NYU sociologist Sarah Cowan, who studies how women talk about **abortion**.
Television shows and movies might also play a role, where plot lines have portrayed **abortion** as a dangerous medical procedure. One 2014 analysis found that 9.3 percent of **abortion** patients on TV and in movies ultimately die from complications of the procedure. (That's 34 times higher than the actual rate.)
""When **abortion** is shown on television, it's often a life-threatening procedure or a very extreme case,"" says Julia Reticker-Flynn, who runs the 1 in 3 Campaign, which encourages women to share their **abortion** stories. ""Even when politicians talk about it, there's an overemphasis on the dangers.""
Women are also reticent to share their **abortion** stories. Cowan at NYU has found that more people say they've had someone tell them about a miscarriage than an **abortion**, even though **abortion** happens more often. This suggests that **abortion** gets kept secret, allowing misperceptions to thrive.
Would the **abortion** debate be different if Americans had more accurate perceptions?
Our poll data does show that people who know someone who had an **abortion** are also more likely to support **abortion** rights.
But that doesn't necessarily mean that hearing about an **abortion** causes pro-choice views. It's possible that people feel more comfortable confiding about their abortions with those who already have liberal views on the topic.
A better understanding of the prevalence of **abortion** might normalize the experience and reduce the stigma around **abortion**. Some advocates think that if Americans were more aware of the frequency of **abortion** — if they knew a neighbor or friend who had terminated a pregnancy — they would become more likely to support **abortion** rights.
Or better knowledge might actually heighten the **abortion** debate. That's because supporters of **abortion** rights and opponents could react very differently to the new information.
""The numbers don't necessarily tell everyone the same story. To some, it might say, 'Look how normal and common this is,'"" Cowan says. ""But if you oppose **abortion**, you might see this and think the problem is way bigger than you realized.""
By magnifying the size of the perceived problem, it could actually intensify the effort to restrict abortions.
PerryUndem Research/Communication conducted the survey among n = 1,060 registered voters 18 and older nationwide, January 20 through 27, 2016. The survey was administered among a nationally representative sample of voters, using GfK's KnowledgePanel. The margin of error is +/- 3.7 percentage points. Some results do not add to 100 percent as a result of rounding. Topline results are available here."
2015-07-01 09:25:00,thedailybeast.com,8.516599,Center,Pro-Lifers Harass Women After Abortions,"The **abortion** debate tends to focus on the time before a woman receives an **abortion**.
In the United States, there are over 3,500 crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs)—most of them “run by conservative Christians,” as The New York Times reports—that pressure pregnant women to either give birth or consider using an adoption agency. Anti-**abortion** billboards dot the interstates with Bible quotes and factoids about fetal heartbeats. Similar ads appear in city centers, often with manipulative racial messaging targeted at pregnant African-American women.
But what happens after **abortion**? One might think that anti-**abortion** organizations would give up on women once they are no longer pregnant. Not so. Anti-**abortion** organizations bearing an uncanny resemblance to CPCs in their approach have a sizable but lesser-known presence in the world of post-**abortion** counseling and support.
Despite a lack of scientific evidence, organizations like The Stacy Zallie Foundation, **Abortion** Changes You, Project Rachel, and several others portray **abortion** itself as a serious threat to women’s mental health. These organizations often posture as neutral havens for post-**abortion** support while explicitly directing women to anti-**abortion** resources, including CPCs. They may not be as numerous as their CPC counterparts, but they can be just as misleading.
If post-**abortion** counseling hasn’t drawn much attention, that may be because it is often unnecessary. In 2008, an American Psychological Association (APA) Task Force reviewed the scientific literature on mental health and **abortion** and concluded, “[T]here is no credible evidence that a single elective **abortion** of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women.”
Although some studies do indicate that “some women” can experience grief, depression, and anxiety after an **abortion**, the Task Force further clarified that “reports of associations between **abortion** history and mental health problems” can be “misleading” if they do not take into account “other risk factors” like poverty, violence, and drug or alcohol use. The best predictor of mental health post-**abortion**, the report found, is mental health pre-**abortion**.
But that hasn’t stopped an array of post-**abortion** organizations, campaigns, and websites from presenting **abortion** as a pressing psychological danger.
The Stacy Zallie Foundation, created by millionaire New Jersey grocer George Zallie and his late wife Linda, promises “non-judgmental post-**abortion** care,” but between the organization’s alarmist tone and its ties to anti-**abortion** organizations, it’s difficult to take that claim seriously. The Zallies created the foundation in the mid-2000s because they were “convinced” that their daughter Stacy would be alive “had [she] been better informed about what she might expect following the **abortion**.”
Stacy committed suicide at age 21, a year after receiving an **abortion**—two incidents that Zallie told local press he “knows in [his] heart” were connected.
The front page of the foundation’s website promises that it “does not operate with religious, ethical, or political agendas in mind” and yet its list of resources includes several CPCs in Pennsylvania, the same CPCs that form the frontline of the anti-**abortion** movement—some New York City CPCs even have the word “frontline” in their names.
These CPCs, which actually outnumber **abortion** providers in the U.S., are far from agenda-less.
When George Washington University Law School student Caitlin Bancroft went undercover to visit several Virginia CPCs, her counselors asked questions like “Would your parents be excited about a grandchild?” and told her that her birth control causes cancer. This all took place while she waited for the results of her free pregnancy test, one of CPCs’ most-advertised offerings. No matter what Bancroft said, the counselors always tried to steer her away from **abortion**.
Others have endured even more horrific experiences inside CPCs. Feminist writer Jaclyn Munson had to watch a 25-minute film detailing the rare complications of **abortion** before receiving the results of her pregnancy test.
The Stacy Zallie Foundation’s alignment with anti-**abortion** groups doesn’t end with its endorsement of CPCs. Aside from the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, the only phone numbers listed at the top of its front page lead to OptionLine, a CPC referral service, and Concepts of Truth International, an organization that sells copies of the exploitative documentary Life After **Abortion**, which features women recalling their abortions in graphic detail:
After a PR email for the Stacy Zallie Foundation went out with a list of unsubstantiated claims about “post **abortion** depression”—such as “45 percent of women who have had an **abortion** report having suicidal feelings immediately following their procedure,” no citation provided—George Zallie did not immediately respond to requests for an interview.
If you enter your ZIP Code in the top right corner of the Stacy Zallie Foundation website, you’ll be redirected to another anti-**abortion** campaign masquerading as a post-**abortion** support service: **Abortion** Changes You. The “Find Help” feature on the **Abortion** Changes You website primarily directs users to local CPCs.
In 2010, **Abortion** Changes You ran a subway ad campaign in New York City with messages like: “I thought life would be the way it was before. **Abortion** changes you.” At the time, founder Michaelene Fredenburg told The New York Times that she wanted **Abortion** Changes You to be a “safe space” for women “apart from the controversy and debate.”
But her ad campaign, as the Times reports, was paid for by Vitae, an anti-**abortion** media organization that conducts “extensive psychological and demographic research” to fine-tune its messages. Vitae’s portfolio includes ads for CPCs in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles featuring black and Latina women, respectively.
A video for **Abortion** Changes You shows pictures of models with messages like “My wife gets depressed around the anniversary of our daughter’s **abortion**” over a mournful piano track. The music swells and shifts to a major key as screenshots of the website replace the sad stock photos.
**Abortion** Changes You fell quiet for some time after its subway ad campaign but, last year, Fredenburg recorded a video appearance for the National Vigil For Life in Ireland, a rally protesting Ireland’s legalization of **abortion**. So much for staying away from “controversy and debate.”
The Stacy Zallie Foundation also lists Rachel’s Vineyard and Project Rachel as resources, both Roman Catholic organizations. The Project Rachel website makes grim reference to “vast literature on post-**abortion** response,” before citing studies that have already been discredited by the APA Task Force on Mental Health and **Abortion** due to methodological problems (PDF).
There are even more anti-**abortion** groups populating the post-**abortion** support space, especially online, where they outnumber more legitimate options in search results.
After **Abortion** offers a quiz to determine if you are suffering from Post **Abortion** Stress Syndrome, or PASS, which is not recognized by any reputable medical association, no matter how official its acronym makes it seem. Silent No More Awareness promises to “make the public aware of the devastation **abortion** brings to women and men.” If you search for “**abortion** after-care programs” through Silent No More, you will generally receive a list of Catholic dioceses and, of course, CPCs. The list goes on.
For the minority of women who do experience long-term psychological distress after **abortion**, there are options for support that do not redirect to anti-**abortion** religious groups and CPCs.
For one, Planned Parenthood offers emotional support to women post-**abortion**. In a statement to The Daily Beast, Dr. Vanessa Cullins, vice president of external medical affairs, said Planned Parenthood recognizes that “women can experience a range of emotions after an **abortion**,” including “anger or sadness,” although “most women feel relief.”
“It’s important to remember that serious, long-term emotional problems after an **abortion** are as uncommon after an **abortion** as they are after giving birth. At Planned Parenthood, we make sure that all women have support before, during, and after an **abortion**. Our health center staff provide compassionate, high-quality care to our patients, which includes emotional support and resources,” Cullins said.
Organizations like Backline and the Connect & Breathe after-**abortion** talkline are two more affirming options.
The nonprofit Exhale is also available as an avowedly apolitical “pro-voice” resource that accepts all kinds of **abortion** experiences. Founded in the early 2000s by Aspen Baker, author of Pro-Voice: How to Keep Listening When the World Wants a Fight, Exhale operates a talkline that “respects and works within your belief system” to offer emotional support. Exhale accepts referrals from both Planned Parenthood and organizations like **Abortion** Changes You.
“Wanting to be a welcoming place for women from all backgrounds is difficult terrain to operate in, but our main goal is always to reach and serve as many women, and men, as possible,” Baker told The Daily Beast. “We are a resource for Christian, pro-life women as well as feminist, pro-choice women, and people who are neither.”
The Stacy Zallie Foundation website lists Exhale as a partner but Baker was quick to clarify that “Exhale has no partnership with [them].”
As is the case with pre-**abortion** support, sources of legitimately non-judgmental post-**abortion** support may be harder to locate—with fewer physical and digital locations—but they do exist."
2017-09-18 11:13:28,thefederalist.com,8.513157,Lean Right,Why You've Never Really Seen Hollywood Portray An Abortion Scene,"Would any of us claim that we had seen an honest portrayal of a triple bypass if we saw nothing more than a man’s face on an operating table?
Over the past few years, Hollywood has given us a handful of opportunities to see women on the big screen undergo an **abortion** procedure.
In 2014, the movie “Obvious Child” graced theaters across the country. Dubbed an “**abortion** comedy” (let’s hope this genre never catches on), the film featured a 20-something comedian who becomes pregnant after a one-night stand. Ultimately, she gets an **abortion**, and the movie is hailed as an “honest” look at the country’s most controversial social issue.
In late 2015, the television show “Scandal” included a scene where Kerry Washington’s character has an **abortion**. The scene was set to the tune “Silent Night,” and dubbed “iconic” by mainstream media. Planned Parenthood loved it and Slate called it a “rare accurate depiction.”
More recently, the show “Glow” featured an **abortion** scene with minimal dialogue and minimal detail. One **abortion** supporter called this an incredibly pro-woman scene with a tone that “ultimately feels real and, quite honestly, right.” The episode shows the character, Ruth, justifying the **abortion** by declaring that it’s “not the right baby.” The view sees Ruth staring at the ceiling as she gets an **abortion** while the show ends. Planned Parenthood called this honest and authentic.
These depictions of **abortion** have been roundly celebrated by **abortion** supporters for the way they injected the **abortion** discussion into the everyday life of the average viewer. Persons who support allowing women to choose **abortion** are thrilled to have **abortion** portrayed in such a positive light and in front of such a large number of people. The chance for everyone to see that **abortion** is both innocent and harmless is a clear reason for advocates to cheer.
But were these scenes as honest as **abortion** supporters want us to believe? Were they an authentic depiction of **abortion** and what happens during the procedure?
None of These Scenes Actually Showed an **Abortion**
These scenes are noteworthy because they all have one thing in common: none actually shows an **abortion**. In each of the scenes, the camera stays on the woman’s face while the doctor aborts the preborn child out of sight from the camera. The woman are given little or no information on their preborn child or provided any explanation of how **abortion** works or the procedure being used.
It’s incredibly misleading to claim that any of these honestly depict an **abortion** when none of them depicts an **abortion** at all. In some instances they show a woman grappling with a decision that is no doubt very difficult, but in no valid way can they be said to accurately portray **abortion**.
Now, one could contend that it would be inadvisable to actually show an **abortion** on screen. **Abortion** advocates will say that because it’s a so-called medical procedure. It’s quite graphic, and such graphic depictions have no place onscreen. That may be true in some cases, but the argument doesn’t hold for movies. It’s also clear that Hollywood has no trouble releasing graphic, envelope-pushing content, so the claim that **abortion** is too graphic can be easily dismissed.
One might also contend that people have no interest in seeing medical procedures onscreen. But even if that’s true, the person would never then claim to see have seen an honest or accurate depiction of a procedure when no procedure had been shown and no discussion of the procedure had taken place.
Would any of us claim that we had seen an honest portrayal of a triple bypass if we saw nothing more than a man’s face on an operating table? Would we claim that we had seen an authentic depiction of an appendectomy after watching a woman saying, “Yes, I’m sure this is what I need to do” as she enters the operating room and the episode ends?
Few people would claim that either of those scenarios represented any sort of meaningful depiction of the given medical procedure. The same is true with **abortion**. Claiming that one has seen an honest portrayal of **abortion** after seeing a woman staring at the ceiling on an operating table is misleading and untrue.
If Hollywood Did Depict **Abortion** Honestly
But what if Hollywood did show an honest depiction of **abortion**? Imagine if Hollywood decided to provide its viewers with an authentic, honest look at an **abortion**. How would that look?
For starters, the woman would be provided education regarding her “condition.” She would be provided an ultrasound to determine how far along she is in the pregnancy. This is necessary to determine what **abortion** procedure should be used. She would then be given information on the development of the fetus (a.k.a. the preborn child), and information regarding the procedure that would be used to complete the **abortion** given the child’s gestational age.
Then, instead of showing the woman’s face during the procedure, they would show what is happening inside the uterus. It would show us the remains of the child after the **abortion** has been completed, and what happens to those remains. If it’s just a standard medical procedure that a woman has a right to, there should be no problem with showing how it works, right?
After all, few people would object, on principle, to seeing a human heart after it has been removed. Even if it made them nauseous, objectors would not see it as inappropriate or inhumane. This type of honesty and openness about the **abortion** procedure would help the average viewer understand the nature and truth of **abortion** on a deeper level.
Lastly, after the **abortion** is complete, the woman would be provided information on recovery times, potential side effects to watch for, and any other follow-up instructions. Now, that would be an honest look at **abortion**. And of course, it will never happen.
Why Hollywood Will Never Be Honest About **Abortion**
Hollywood will never be this honest because the truth about **abortion** is that it’s not simply removing a human body part, it’s a human being. That human has its own DNA, its own body parts, and its own life. It’s far easier to simply dismiss the preborn child as a “blob of tissue” or a “clump of cells” than to legitimately talk about the biology of fetal development. Hollywood will never show an actual **abortion** because it would remove all doubt about whether **abortion** takes the life of an innocent human being.
Hollywood will never be this honest because it knows **abortion** is not just a standard medical procedure, it’s a violent act of aggression against a tiny human being who cannot defend himself. Former **abortion** clinic director Abby Johnson often tells the story of why she left her lucrative career, and it centers on her experience of seeing an unborn child on an ultrasound machine move away from the instrument the abortionist had inserted into the woman’s uterus. In that moment, Johnson saw the truth of **abortion**, and the violence of an **abortion** procedure. Hollywood will never show an **abortion** because it can’t risk too many people having that type of experience.
Hollywood will never be this honest about **abortion** because it would have to come out from hiding behind the veneer of “women’s rights” and “my body, my choice.” It would have to cast aside the pleasantries of “reproductive health” and face the reality that **abortion** doesn’t simply affect a woman, it affects an unborn child who is growing inside her.
It’s far easier to simply show the face of the woman and forget that there is even a child there with whom to be concerned. But an honest portrayal of **abortion** would need to acknowledge that a human life is taken, and would require even the most ardent supporters of **abortion** to acknowledge the violence of an **abortion** procedure.
Hollywood has a long history of supporting women’s choice of **abortion**. But even in today’s climate of radical selfism, it would be far too dangerous to show the truth of an **abortion** procedure. The truth has a tendency to change minds when it reaches people, and if people were to see the truth of **abortion**, it’s likely that many would cease to support the practice.
What Happens When People See the Truth
To that end, pro-life advocacy group Live Action has been working in conjunction with former abortionist Dr. Anthony Levatino to create a series of animated videos showing various types of **abortion** procedures. Even cartoon depictions of **abortion** procedures are jarring, and the videos have caused people to change their minds about **abortion** on the spot. It is no surprise that when individuals are confronted with the reality of **abortion** and what it does to a preborn child, their eyes are opened to the injustice. It would be difficult to watch the videos and continue to see **abortion** as a legitimate choice.
To make sure that **abortion** does continue as a legal and legitimate choice, people who advocate for the practice have a vested interest in making sure that the reality stays hidden. The **abortion** industry has long hidden behind a veil of dishonesty, and Hollywood has certainly contributed to that. To expose the truth of **abortion** would undermine the foundation of deception on which the **abortion** industry rests, and Hollywood surely has no interest in that.
So as **abortion** becomes less of a taboo topic, we can expect to see more of it from filmmakers and show writers. In each case, we will likely continue to hear about how honest the writers and directors are in depicting the woman’s choice to abort. But we can be sure that we will never be exposed to the ins and outs of what happens during an **abortion** procedure.
Such a depiction would be anathema in a place such as Hollywood, which has a long history of promoting **abortion** and the **abortion** industry. Forcing viewers to grapple with the violence of an **abortion** procedure is not something we should expect from Hollywood."

2016-05-11 18:30:02,vox.com,8.507611,Lean Left,Abortion rates in North America and Europe are now at 30-year lows,"**Abortion** rates have plummeted in developed countries over the past three decades, new data published Wednesday in the Lancet with the Guttmacher Institute shows.
In the early 1990s, there were 45 abortions for every 1,000 women between ages 15 and 44. That figure has now dropped to 27 abortions per 1,000 women.
The decline spans from the United States and Canada across the Atlantic Ocean to European nations. It does not, however, hold true in developing African, Asian, and Latin American countries, where **abortion** rates have either held steady or slightly increased since the 1990s.
**Abortion** rates plummeting in Europe, North America
**Abortion** rate per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44
The declining **abortion** rates in the developed world, experts say, tell a story about better access to contraceptives. More frequent use of better birth control gives women more control over their fertility — and ultimately seems to lower **abortion** rates internationally.
""When contraceptives aren't available, women use **abortion**, even if it isn't legally sanctioned and even if it puts them at great physical risk,"" Diana Greene Foster, an associate professor at University of California San Francisco who studies **abortion** and contraception and has received the Lancet data, wrote in an email. ""When contraceptives are more available, use of **abortion** declines.""
Three key facts from the Lancet's big, new **abortion** study
The new Lancet data is one of the most comprehensive looks at international **abortion** data in recent years. It looks at trends in **abortion** rates as well as the demographics of who gets abortions. Here are a few of the most notable and surprising findings:
Countries where **abortion** is illegal don't have lower **abortion** rates. Lancet researchers looked at the legal status of **abortion** and found that it didn't correlate with lower **abortion** rates. Women were still terminating pregnancies despite the legal restrictions. This might reflect the fact that countries outlawing **abortion** also tend to have higher levels of women with unmet needs for birth control, which, the researchers say, ""contributes to the incidence of **abortion** in countries with restrictive laws.""

Married women have higher **abortion** rates than unmarried women. The media often portrays the typical **abortion** patient as an unmarried woman who isn't ready to care for a child on her own. But that doesn't capture the demographics of **abortion** patients accurately. The Lancet data finds that married women generally have higher **abortion** rates. This is especially true in Europe, where the **abortion** rate for married women is more than twice as high as the **abortion** rate for unmarried women. North America, however, is an exception: **Abortion** rates here are slightly lower for married women.

North America, however, is an exception: **Abortion** rates here are slightly lower for married women. **Abortion** rates vary hugely by country. Caribbean countries currently have the highest **abortion** rates (65 per 1,000 women between 15 and 45). The lowest **abortion** rates are in North America (17 per 1,000 women) and Europe (18 per 1,000 women). Europe has experienced the sharpest decline in **abortion** rates, falling 79 percent since the early 1990s.
Better birth control, fewer abortions: explaining the developed world's **abortion** decline
The declining **abortion** rates are limited to the developed world. In developed countries, **abortion** rates appear to be either flat or rising.
**Abortion** rates per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44
One big differentiator between these countries seems to be access to contraceptives.
Modern birth control has become ubiquitous in developed countries. In the United States, for example, 99.1 percent of women who have had sex say they've used at least one contraceptive method — up from 94.8 percent in 1982. The United Nations has found that in most European countries, contraceptive use is well above 70 percent.
Birth control itself is getting better, too: Long-acting, reversible contraceptives like implants and modern IUDs have only come on the market over the past two decades. These contraceptives have failure rates below 1 percent — meaning that of 100 users, fewer than 1 will become pregnant. That's a huge improvement over condoms' 18 percent failure rate or even the birth control pill's 8 percent failure rate.
Access to these contraceptives has steadily increased in developed countries, making it easier to prevent pregnancy. But the same isn't true of developing countries, some of which have fewer than 20 percent of women in relationships using contraceptives.
UCSF's Greene Foster notes that there can be cultural obstacles even when contraceptives are available.
""In countries across the developing world, the most common reasons for not using a method of contraception are perceived low risk of pregnancy, a personal opposition to using contraception, and concerns about the health effects or side-effects of contraceptive use,"" she writes in a separate Lancet piece.
Addressing those types of concerns will likely prove key, then, to increasing contraceptive use in the areas of the world where rates still remain low.

The almost-certain confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court has increased the chances that Roe v. Wade will be weakened or overturned. If that were to happen, **abortion** access would decline in large regions of the country, a new data analysis shows.
Legal **abortion** access would be unchanged in more than half of states, but it would effectively end for those living in much of the American South and Midwest, especially those who are poor, according to the analysis. (The analysis incorporates more recent data on research we wrote about last year.)
“A post-Roe United States isn’t one in which **abortion** isn’t legal at all,” said Caitlin Knowles Myers, an economist at Middlebury College and a co-author of the original research. She obtained and analyzed the new data for The New York Times this month. “It’s one in which there’s tremendous inequality in **abortion** access.”
Today, there is at least one **abortion** clinic in every state, and most women of childbearing age live within an hour’s drive or so of one, the analysis found. Without Roe, **abortion** would probably become illegal in 22 states. Forty-one percent of women of childbearing age would see the nearest **abortion** clinic close, and the average distance they would have to travel to reach one would be 280 miles, up from 36 miles now.
As distances to clinics increase, **abortion** rates decline, research shows. Women who can’t afford to travel to a legal clinic or arrange child care or leave from work for the trip are most affected. Also, remaining clinics would not necessarily be able to handle increased demand.
Without Roe, the number of legal abortions in the United States would be at least 14 percent lower, Professor Myers and her colleagues estimated. That could mean about 100,000 fewer legal abortions a year, they found. The number is impossible to predict precisely because new clinics could open on state borders, and some people may order **abortion** pills by mail or obtain illegal surgical abortions, which may be dangerous.
Travel distances could increase even if Roe weren’t overturned, because a more conservative court could decide to uphold state laws that decrease access to abortions, such as those that require **abortion** providers to have hospital admitting privileges, require women seeking abortions to wait for long intervals first or restrict the kinds of **abortion** procedures that are allowed.
Anti-**abortion** activists and politicians who have sought the elimination of Roe have long pinned their hopes on state legislatures to pass these kinds of laws, because passing **abortion** restrictions through Congress has proved difficult.
“It would be a whole lot better for **abortion** policy if the states were allowed to have their regulations stood up and unchallenged,” said Charmaine Yoest, the vice president for the Institute for Family, Community and Opportunity at the Heritage Foundation, and the former president of Americans United for Life. “You would have the laws reflecting the folks in those states, and that’s what American federalism is supposed to be.”
Ms. Yoest noted that not every state that would pursue new **abortion** regulations would necessarily ban the procedure.
Long travel distances are already a challenge for women in some areas. In parts of Missouri and Mississippi, where state officials have worked hard to limit abortions, many women live 250 or more miles from the nearest **abortion** clinic, far enough that their access wouldn’t be changed much if **abortion** were outlawed. In other parts of the country, like the Northeast and the West Coast, where there is little appetite for **abortion** restrictions, **abortion** access is also unlikely to change.
Ten states, including Idaho and Utah this year, have passed so-called trigger laws, which would automatically ban all abortions without Roe. An additional 12 states are considered highly likely to pass new **abortion** bans in a new legal environment, based on recent legislative action and state court rulings. Changes in state politics have made other states, like Wisconsin, less likely to do so.
“What’s interesting about the modeling is it’s less about Judge Barrett being confirmed to the Supreme Court than the importance of the state politics, and the state politics become that much more important in a world without Roe,” Professor Myers said.

The estimates are based on two elements: research of how recent clinic closings in Texas affected **abortion** rates among women whose driving distance to providers increased, and two sets of assumptions about which states might outlaw **abortion** if Roe were overturned.
That research was published last year in the journal Contraception by Professor Myers; Rachel K. Jones, a sociologist at the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports reproductive rights; and Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco. It was updated for The New York Times this month by Professor Myers to account for changes in state laws and the locations of **abortion** clinics. She has been paid by **abortion** rights groups as an expert witness.
A recent study from a different research team on the effects of **abortion** clinic closings in Wisconsin showed a similar relationship between increased drive times and the number of abortions performed at clinics.

Legal scholars cannot predict what the Supreme Court will do, and Judge Barrett in her confirmation hearings this week declined to give her views on **abortion** law.
“I think what’s more likely to happen, rather than have a full-on immediate reversal of Roe, is they take on some of these new regulations and see how much they can achieve without having that out-and-out reversal,” said Gillian Metzger, a professor of constitutional law at Columbia.
Even with that strategy, the decrease in access to **abortion** could look very similar to what Professor Myers and her co-authors mapped out. The data is based on what happened in Texas when a law, before it was overturned, restricted access to **abortion** but did not ban it. The Supreme Court could now decide to uphold such laws, Professor Metzger said.
“If the question is will we see reductions in access, yes, I think we will,” she said."
2015-05-13 14:24:00,vox.com,8.465325,Lean Left,10 facts that explain how America regulates abortion,"The **abortion** rate has fallen steadily for years, decreasing nearly every year since 1981. In 2012, it was at the lowest level recorded since 1973, when the Supreme Court legalized **abortion** in its Roe v. Wade ruling.
America's **abortion** rate has steadily declined since the 1980s
In 2012, the most recent year for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has data, there were 699,202 legal, induced abortions in the United States. The **abortion** rate for 2012 was 13.2 abortions per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44.
The federal government tracks both the number of abortions and **abortion** rate and, since the 1980s, their data has shown a steep decline. The 2012 numbers mark the lowest **abortion** rate since 1973, the year that the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision created a legal right to **abortion** access.
Meanwhile, the national trend has moved in favor of more aggressive **abortion** regulation. Legislatures across the country passed more restrictions between 2011 and 2013 than they did in the prior decade. These restrictions have led to some **abortion** clinics closing because they found it too onerous to come into compliance.
Those new regulations have catalyzed new lawsuits: most recently, the fight centers over state requirements that **abortion** doctors have admitting privileges at local hospitals. These new restrictions have forced courts to dive back into a controversial issue, and further clarify what type of **abortion** regulation is legal in America.
**Abortion** patients are disproportionately young, nonwhite, and poor
Women obtaining abortions are disproportionately young, minority, unmarried, and likely to already have at least one child.
The majority of women obtaining abortions — 58 percent — are in their 20s, according to a 2010 report from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that conducts research on reproductive health. The same report found that non-Hispanic white women account for 36 percent of abortions, black women for 30 percent, and Hispanic women for 25 percent.
Forty-two percent of women who got abortions in 2008 lived below the poverty line (for an individual, this would mean earning less than about $11,000). In 2000, the last time the survey was conducted, only 27 percent of **abortion** patients were beneath the poverty line — suggesting that **abortion** services are becoming more concentrated among poorer women.
The same report found that 85 percent of **abortion** patients are unmarried (though 29 percent were cohabiting with their partner). About 60 percent of women receiving abortions already have one child — that includes 34 percent who already had two or more children.
A first-trimester **abortion** costs about $500. Most women pay that out-of-pocket.
The average first-trimester **abortion** cost $470 in 2009, the most recent year for which data is available. Most patients pay for their abortions out-of-pocket, although some use Medicaid or private insurance coverage.
Another 20 percent use Medicaid, a federal-state program that provides health coverage to low-income Americans (32 states and the District of Columbia cover **abortion** procedures; the rest do not). States have a choice of whether to include **abortion** as a covered benefit, and if they do, a federal law known as the Hyde Amendment requires they do so with state, rather than federal, funds.
Twelve percent of **abortion** patients use private insurance coverage to pay for their procedure. This number could drop, as many states have recently passed laws restricting insurance coverage of **abortion**. Thirteen percent of **abortion** patients use some type of financial assistance, typically a privately run fund dedicated to helping women who can't afford the procedure.
**Abortion** clinics are closing, and the number of providers is rapidly declining
In the late 1970s, nearly 3,000 doctors performed abortions. But that number has shrunk significantly, hitting 1,720 doctors performing at least one **abortion** in 2011. That's a small sliver of the 834,000 licensed doctors in the United States.
The number of **abortion** providers in the United States decreased by 38 percent between 1982 and 2005, according to the Guttmacher Institute.
As to why the numbers declined, a number of factors are likely at play. Especially notable are the increases in state-level restrictions and a wave of violence against **abortion** providers in the 1990s, when five were killed. Being an **abortion** provider often isn't like being another type of doctor; it requires more risk and concern for safety. Some wear bulletproof vests to work after experiencing direct threats of violence.
""I'm mindful of my circumstances,"" says Willie Parker, a physician who runs Mississippi's only **abortion** clinic. ""I lock my car. I have contact with law enforcement, in terms of reaching out if I need to. I don't carry a gun, but I'm prepared to defend myself.""
Clinics close in the face of new regulation
As the number of **abortion** providers has declined, so has the number of **abortion** clinics. There are now four states — Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming — that have only a single facility licensed to perform abortions.
This means that, increasingly, it is harder for women to terminate pregnancies. Just over one-third of American women of reproductive age now live in counties that do not have **abortion** clinics. One study from the Guttmacher Institute found that, on average, American women travel 30 miles to access **abortion** services. Seventeen percent of women traveled more than 50 miles to terminate a pregnancy. **Abortion** services tend to be more accessible in the Northeast and the West and less accessible in the South and the Midwest. In some areas of North Dakota and South Dakota, women live more than 350 miles from an **abortion** clinic.
State laws have increasingly passed laws that regulate **abortion** clinics more aggressively, like requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital, for example, or adopting stricter building requirements. And in some places, you see this resulting in many clinic closures. After Texas passed these types of regulations, for example the number of clinics dropped from 43 in August 2013 to eight in October 2014.
Roe v. Wade guarantees a legal right to **abortion**
Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision, declared a legal right to some, but not all, abortions. At the time of the Roe decision, **abortion** was illegal in most states except for cases where the woman's life would be endangered by carrying the pregnancy to term.
In the Roe decision, the Supreme Court found that a constitutional right to privacy protected a woman's decision to terminate a pregnancy. The court also ruled that that right must be weighed against two legitimate interests of states: protecting prenatal life and women's health.
To balance those two factors, Roe set forth a viability standard, which tethered states' **abortion**-regulation rights to the gestational point in a woman's pregnancy. According to Roe, states cannot bar abortions before a fetus is able to live outside the womb (usually thought to be between 24 and 28 weeks after conception). But Roe gives states the authority to ban abortions after this viability point, so long as such restrictions include exceptions for the health or life of the mother.
But states still have legal authorities to restrict **abortion** access
Roe did not offer legal protection to all instances of **abortion**. Instead, it gave states the authority to ban abortions after a fetus is viable (usually thought to be around 25 or 26 weeks) if they include an exception for procedures that preserve the life or health of the woman. Forty-one states now ban **abortion** after a certain point in pregnancy.
And in further decisions, the Supreme Court has specifically ruled in favor of restrictions earlier in the pregnancy, too. Those are now subject to an ""undue burden"" standard: namely, that these types of laws cannot place an ""undue burden"" on the patient. In the mid-1990s, the Supreme Court defined this type of burden as a ""substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an **abortion** before the fetus attains viability.""
Still, many **abortion** lawsuits now center on the question of what counts as an ""undue burden."" In one landmark 1996 case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court ruled that a spousal notification requirement — where a woman wanting to have an **abortion** would have to give prior notice to her husband — violated the undue burden standard. Other restrictions, like a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent for minors, were not found to violate the standard — and now exist in many other states.
States passed 231 **abortion** restrictions between 2011 and 2014
Over the past five years — particularly 2011 and 2012 — there has been a massive spike in state **abortion** regulations. States passed 231 restrictions between 2011 and 2014 — more than the prior three decades combined. In that same time, only one state has expanded access to **abortion**: California passed a law in 2013 that allows more medical professionals, like nurse practitioners, to perform abortions.
20-week bans, targeted regulations of clinic have spread across the country
**Abortion** restrictions often come in waves; one state will pass a new type of law and then others follow. Nebraska, for example, passed the first 20-week **abortion** in 2010. Eight more states have since gone on to pass similar legislation. Another case: between 2011 and 2014, the number of states requiring **abortion** providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital jumped from two to 11.
The wave of new **abortion** restrictions tend to cluster around specific approaches to regulation. About half of those enacted since 2011 fall into four categories: bans on **abortion** at 20 weeks, limitations on insurance coverage of **abortion**, limitations on medical abortions, and targeted regulations of **abortion** providers (like the admitting privilege laws).
There are two factors that likely contribute to the rise in **abortion** restrictions. The national debate over health care reform catalyzed a separate battle over whether health insurance plans should cover abortions as part of their benefits package.
A few months after Obamacare passed, Republicans took control of more state legislatures, giving them an easier path to passing bills that restricted **abortion** access. By the end of 2010, **abortion** had become a prominent political issue — and Republicans had more political clout to take action.
**Abortion** restrictions appear to lead to fewer abortions, though the evidence is mixed
A 1995 study of states that didn't cover abortions in their Medicaid programs found that those places had lower **abortion** rates, suggesting that the restriction did limit the termination of pregnancies. Another study, published in 1996, found that parental notification laws — which require minors to get a parent's consent prior to obtaining an **abortion** — reduced minors' demand for **abortion** by 13 percent to 24 percent.
**Abortion** restrictions may have an effect on when women terminate pregnancies, too. A paper in the Journal of Health Economics found that parental notification laws and waiting periods are associated with an increase in the proportion of abortions that occur after the first trimester.
But one 2011 study in the Lancet showed, somewhat counterintuitively, that countries with fewer **abortion** restrictions tend to have a lower rate of **abortion** than those with more restrictions. The authors of this paper suggest that the lower **abortion** rate in less restrictive countries may have to do with more frequent contraceptive use among women.
Obamacare does not fund abortions
One of the last sticking points to get resolved in the national health reform debate was whether the plans offered on the exchanges would pay for abortions. In response, President Obama issued an executive order that prohibits tax subsidies from paying for abortions, except in cases of rape and incest. Instead, insurers would need to use the part of the premium paid by individuals to cover pregnancy terminations.
Enough anti-**abortion** legislators were won over by this executive order to pass Obamacare. Many pro-life groups, however, still contend there isn't a strict enough firewall between tax subsidies insurers receive and the **abortion** claims they pay out.
Since Obamacare passed, many states have taken steps to restrict insurers' ability to cover **abortion** in their health plans. Twenty-three states restrict or ban **abortion** coverage on the health insurance exchanges; eight states have laws that restrict **abortion** coverage for all private plans.
Americans' views on **abortion** aren't so black and white
**Abortion** often gets framed as a divisive issue; Americans either support a woman's legal right to terminate a pregnancy, or they don't. And it is true, when you ask Americans to identify as ""pro-life"" or ""pro-choice"" — as Gallup does in its regular polling — there is a stark divide.
But its not totally clear whether this is the right way to ask the question — and whether it captures the nuance to how Americans think about a difficult and personal policy issue.
In a recent Vox poll, we found that 21 percent of Americans identify as ""both"" pro-choice and pro-life if given the option of that response. Another 18 percent identify as neither. This means that about four in ten Americans don't subscribe exclusively to either of the labels we think of as defining the **abortion** issue. You can read more about the Vox poll, and how Americans think about **abortion**, here."
2016-05-04 11:21:45,thefederalist.com,8.46306,Lean Right,Abortion Is Not Safer Than Giving Birth,"In an attempt to prove **abortion** safer than childbirth, Vox compares two data points from the Centers for Disease Control that the CDC itself has said are not comparable.
It’s understandable that pro-**abortion** advocates were eager to circulate a Vox video purporting to prove the safety of **abortion** last week. After all, yet another **abortion** clinic was making headlines for unsanitary conditions and harm to patients, drawing attention to the need for enforcing the health and safety laws **abortion** proponents bitterly fight. But the attempted defense of **abortion** Vox’s Liz Plank offered may actually be worse than her attempt at humor with a “Knock, knock. Who’s there? **Abortion**” joke.
Notably, before repeating the discredited myth that “**abortion** is safer than childbirth,” Plank admits a profound truth that **abortion** advocates generally avoid. By prefacing her arguments with the statement “if you only look at the safety of the mother,” she tacitly recognizes that **abortion** concerns the safety of two human beings. **Abortion** is always unsafe for the baby. (You know, that whole “crushing of body parts” that Plank displays annoyance over pro-lifers being “particularly vocal” about lately.)
After acknowledging that pregnant women are, in fact, mothers, Plank alleges “**abortion** is actually safer than childbirth” by comparing two data points from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that the CDC itself has said are not comparable. Maternal mortality and **abortion** mortality “measures are conceptually different and are used by CDC for different health purposes.” In other words, Plank peddles apples-to-oranges numbers as the basis of her claim.
**Abortion** Is Much Riskier Than Birth
Contrary to Plank’s attempt to soften abortion’s image by alleging that “most abortions don’t involve any form of cutting or surgery,” the vast majority of abortions are accomplished by invasive procedures that carry risks including, according to Planned Parenthood: “injury to the cervix or other organs.”
The risks to a woman’s short- and long-term physical health are real and deserve serious attention.
Other immediate physical risks from **abortion** procedures that even Planned Parenthood acknowledges include “allergic reaction, blood clots in the uterus, incomplete **abortion** — part of the pregnancy is left inside the uterus, failure to end the pregnancy, undetected ectopic pregnancy, very heavy bleeding.” These risks “increase the longer you are pregnant. They also increase if you have sedation or general anesthesia.”
Chemical abortions have a lengthy list of known complications, too. Some recent studies have even found higher incidences of immediate adverse events for chemical abortions than for surgical abortions.
Regardless of what type of **abortion** a mother undergoes—a 15-minute invasive procedure, a lengthier surgery, or multiple days of potent drugs—an abortion’s consequences are profound. The risks to her short- and long-term physical health are real and deserve serious attention.
Also, **Abortion** Data Is Unreliable
The problems with Plank’s defense of **abortion** run deeper than her euphemisms and faulty use of dissimilar CDC statistics, because U.S. **abortion** data is known to be incomplete and unreliable.
There is no federal **abortion** reporting requirement. Even the pro-**abortion** Guttmacher Institute acknowledges that the current “patchwork of surveillance efforts” relies on “incomplete” reports from states and that California—estimated to account for 17 percent, or one out of every six abortions in the country—is one of three states that “do not report to the CDC at all.” Guttmacher uses voluntary reporting from abortionists, filtered through its own ideological lens, which fails to fill these gaping holes.
Even pro-**abortion** advocates have said women face significant obstacles when reporting complaints against **abortion** providers.
Other factors compound the poor quality of reporting on **abortion** and **abortion** complications. Even pro-**abortion** advocates have said women face significant obstacles when reporting complaints against **abortion** providers. Susan Schewel, the executive director of the Women’s Medical Fund in Philadelphia, explained that, in her experience trying to work with women to file complaints with the Pennsylvania Department of Health, “The women found the complaint process so onerous and the telling of their stories so personally difficult that they failed to complete the paperwork and abandoned the effort.”
Abortionists have allegedly discouraged women from being truthful about their **abortion** complications. A former Planned Parenthood employee’s “whistleblower” lawsuit explains that chemical **abortion** patients who later experienced significant bleeding were told “to go to an emergency room and report that they were experiencing a spontaneous miscarriage.”
Still other complications are unreported because they go unconnected to the **abortion** that caused them. Jayne Mitchell-Werbrich, a nurse who left Planned Parenthood of Delaware because of its “meat market type assembly line care,” not because of any change of heart on **abortion**, testified before the Delaware Senate that “the sad thing is that these women may not even realize the fact that Planned Parenthood could be at fault for these medical tragedies even years after they had their abortions at Planned Parenthood.”
Women Deserve to Know These Risks
Further, Plank uncritically parrots the **abortion** industry’s talking points about the impact of Texas health and safety standards on clinic closures—talking points Texas has already exposed in its brief before the Supreme Court as “inaccurate representations about whether HB 2 caused certain **abortion** clinics to close.” In an “Impact of HB2” map they created and provided to the Supreme Court, lawyers for the abortionists challenging the Texas law went so far as to include clinics that closed before HB2 even passed.
Plank’s attempt to discredit proponents of health and safety standards ignores the ugly realities of the **abortion** industry these laws address.
While Plank would have viewers blindly mourn any clinic closures, her attempt to discredit proponents of health and safety standards ignores the ugly realities of the **abortion** industry these laws address. The inherent risks of **abortion** are amplified by an industry that has a long history of bad actors placing profit as their highest priority.
On one point Plank and I agree. We should be talking more about **abortion** and its risks. Although another talking point she repeats—that about 1 out of every 3 women will have an **abortion** in their lifetimes—has earned a “Two Pinocchios” rating in the Washington Post as a stale claim that fails to take into account declining **abortion** rates, the high numbers of annual abortions should elevate concerns about the unarguable risks. Even modest risks of harm have a large impact.
Plank set out to prove that passion clouds facts, and ends up proving her own point. If Plank is genuinely interested in helping women, instead of dialing up an abortionist to give a sales pitch for the business she profits from, she should join us in calling for national **abortion** reporting laws."
2020-02-26 08:10:00,vox.com,8.456837,Lean Left,"The Supreme Court case that could end Roe v. Wade, explained","The constitutional right to an **abortion** is most likely in its final days, though there is considerable uncertainty about whether the Supreme Court will explicitly overrule Roe v. Wade or simply hollow out the right until it becomes meaningless. June Medical Services v. Russo, a case that the Supreme Court will hear next Wednesday, could easily be the case that drains this right of its remaining force.
The right to an abortion’s fate was likely sealed in October of 2018, when Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to a seat on the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh’s predecessor, Justice Anthony Kennedy, spent many years maintaining an uneasy equilibrium between four justices who oppose the **abortion** right and four who’ve spent their time on the Court defending it. Though Kennedy typically voted to uphold **abortion** restrictions, he also recoiled at laws that cut so deeply into the **abortion** right as to render it meaningless.
But Kennedy is gone, and Kavanaugh is widely expected to join his four colleagues who reject the right to terminate a pregnancy. In his short time on the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh already tried to impose new procedural barriers on **abortion** plaintiffs that could have rendered the right virtually unenforceable.
The law at issue in June Medical will be familiar to anyone who has followed the last several years of **abortion** litigation. Indeed, it’s hard to escape a sense of déjà vu.
In Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt (2016), the Supreme Court struck down two provisions of a Texas law that sought to make it harder to obtain an **abortion**. One of those provisions required **abortion** providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.
June Medical, meanwhile, involves a Louisiana law that is virtually identical to the admitting privileges law struck down in Whole Woman’s Health. While the two laws are tough to distinguish, the Court is very different today than it was in 2016. Kennedy provided the key fifth vote to strike down the Texas law in Whole Woman’s Health. And Kennedy is no longer around to reaffirm that decision.
While it is overwhelmingly likely that five justices will vote to uphold Louisiana’s law, there is some uncertainty about how they will do so. It is possible that the Court will overrule Roe v. Wade outright. But it is at least as likely that the Court will leave Roe nominally in place while simultaneously watering down the **abortion** right to such a degree that it loses meaning in red states. The Court often prefers to create the impression that it will not allow the law to swing wildly according to the justices’ whims.
Broadly speaking, if the Supreme Court decides not to explicitly overrule Roe, there are two ways that June Medical could go down.
Banning **abortion** through sham health laws
**Abortion**-rights advocates often refer to laws like the one at issue in June Medical as targeted restrictions on **abortion** providers, or “TRAP” laws — laws that superficially appear to make abortions safer but whose real purpose is to make it much harder to operate an **abortion** clinic. On the surface, hospital admitting privileges seem to be a valuable credential that can be used to screen out doctors that — at least in the opinion of local hospitals — cannot be trusted to treat patients.
But the reality is that this credential is very difficult for many **abortion** providers to obtain. And requiring **abortion** doctors to obtain such a credential does little to make abortions safer.
One of the most sophisticated anti-**abortion** groups in the country is Americans United for Life (AUL), a group that writes “model” anti-**abortion** legislation that can be taken up by state lawmakers. In 2014, AUL took credit for 74 anti-**abortion** laws enacted by state legislatures in the proceeding four years.
Both the Texas admitting privileges law at issue in Whole Woman’s Health and the Louisiana law at the heart of June Medical closely resemble the “**Abortion** Providers’ Privileging Act,” model legislation drafted and promoted by AUL.
Significantly, AUL did not promote this model bill as an anti-**abortion** measure — or, at least, it did not do so in its public-facing advocacy. A 2012 document promoting the model legislation, for example, claimed that “**abortion** clinics across the nation have become the true ‘back-alleys’ of **abortion** mythology.” Legalizing **abortion**, it claimed, “has not eliminated substandard medical care, kept people without medical licenses from performing abortions, ensured competent post-**abortion** care, nor prevented women from dying from unsafe abortions.”
Thus, AUL claimed that admitting privileges are a useful credential that can be used to screen out incompetent **abortion** providers. “States laws mandating that **abortion** providers have hospital admitting privileges,” it claimed, “are critical to ensuring that women receive proper and competent **abortion** care.”
This messaging — that admitting privileges laws are intended to protect women’s health and not to shut down **abortion** clinics — formed the backbone of Texas’s defense of its admitting privileges law. And it also animates Louisiana’s arguments in June Medical. The Louisiana law, according to the state’s brief in June Medical, was enacted to promote “**abortion** safety by means of doctor credentialing.”
Yet the Supreme Court soundly rejected this justification for admitting privileges law in Whole Woman’s Health.
In Casey, the Supreme Court held that “unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an **abortion** impose an undue burden on the right.” Admitting privileges laws, the Court held in Whole Woman’s Health, are just such an unnecessary regulation.
As Justice Stephen Breyer explained in that case, abortions are a very safe medical procedure — “less than one-quarter of 1 percent” of first trimester abortions result in complications. Indeed, complications from abortions are so rare that **abortion** doctors often struggle to obtain admitting privileges for this very reason: Many hospitals only grant admitting privileges to physicians who admit a certain number of patients every year.
Admitting privileges laws, in other words, impose a significant burden on **abortion** clinics and on those clinics’ patients, while doing very little to make an already very safe medical procedure any safer. If the Louisiana law is allowed to take effect, it’s expected to close at least two of the three **abortion** clinics within that state. More broadly, according to the Guttmacher Institute, TRAP laws led to the closure of half the clinics in Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, and Texas between 2011 and 2017.
The Supreme Court could potentially use June Medical to give a broad blessing to TRAP laws. And such a decision would not need to explicitly overrule Roe in order to drastically roll back or even eliminate the right to an **abortion**.
The Texas law at issue in Whole Woman’s Health, for example, did not simply require **abortion** providers to obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital. It also required most clinics to make expensive improvements to their facilities — some of which had nothing to do with the actual medical care provided by those facilities.
If the Louisiana law is upheld, states could potentially require **abortion** doctors to obtain more and more difficult-to-obtain credentials, while simultaneously requiring the clinics themselves to pay for millions of dollars in unnecessary equipment. Eventually, these burdens would become so great that no **abortion** clinic could afford to operate, and the right to an **abortion** would cease to exist in states led by anti-**abortion** lawmakers.
Banning **abortion** by preventing anyone from suing to enforce their rights
Alternatively, the Supreme Court could drastically limit **abortion** rights by making it much harder for anyone to bring a lawsuit challenging an anti-**abortion** law and by providing only very narrow relief to plaintiffs who do prevail in an **abortion** case.
June Medical is technically two consolidated cases, June Medical Services v. Russo and Russo v. June Medical Services. The first case concerns the constitutionality of Louisiana’s admitting privileges law. The second concerns a threshold question — whether the right party brought this lawsuit in the first place.
The plaintiffs in these cases are an **abortion** clinic and two physicians who wish to provide **abortion** care in Louisiana. The Supreme Court established more than four decades ago that **abortion** providers may sue to challenge a state law restricting **abortion**, but both Louisiana and the Trump administration now ask the Supreme Court to overrule this long-standing rule.
The general rule is that a plaintiff in federal court “must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.” Thus, because the right to an **abortion** belongs to the person seeking an **abortion**, the ordinary rule would require that person to be the plaintiff in any lawsuit challenging an **abortion** restriction.
But the Supreme Court allows third parties to bring a lawsuit when “the party asserting the right has a ‘close’ relationship with the person who possesses the right” and “there is a ‘hindrance’ to the possessor’s ability to protect his own interests.” This doctrine is known as “third-party standing.”
Under this third-party standing doctrine, the Court allowed **abortion** providers to challenge laws restricting **abortion**. As Justice Harry Blackmun explained in Singleton v. Wulff (1976), “the constitutionally protected **abortion** decision is one in which the physician is intimately involved.” And **abortion** patients may be hindered in their ability to assert their rights, in no small part because someone seeking an **abortion** is likely to give birth before their rights are fully litigated.
Now, however, Louisiana wants to eliminate this rule allowing **abortion** providers to sue on behalf of their patients. **Abortion** providers interests, it claims, “potentially conflict with” the interests of their patients when a state enacts health regulations. If, in fact, the admitting privileges law is a credentialing requirement enacted in good faith to protect patients from incompetent doctors, then the doctor’s interest diverges from that of the patient. The doctor wants to be free from a burdensome regulation, but the patient wants to be sure that they will receive competent care.
It’s a clever argument, but it’s hard to square with Whole Woman’s Health, which already determined that admitting privileges laws do little to protect patient health.
The argument also assumes its own conclusion. After all, the core constitutional question in June Medical is whether Louisiana’s law is a legitimate health regulation or a sham law enacted to shut down **abortion** clinics. But the state effectively asks the justices to assume one answer to this question and then use that assumption to lock **abortion** providers out of court.
If the Supreme Court buys this argument, that would force **abortion**-rights lawyers to find an actual pregnant person who wants to get an **abortion** but is prevented from doing so by a state **abortion** restriction, every time it wanted to bring a lawsuit challenging such a restriction. That inconvenience wouldn’t be enough to shut down **abortion** litigation entirely — Roe v. Wade was brought by an individual woman seeking an **abortion** — but it would make it significantly harder to find plaintiffs.
One recent study, for example, found that 60 percent of individuals who stated publicly that they had an **abortion** “reported experiencing harassment and other negative incidents after sharing their story.” A potential plaintiff in an **abortion** case may not want to risk such a consequence.
A decision preventing doctors and clinics from bringing **abortion** lawsuits would be devastating to the **abortion** right, moreover, if it were combined with another procedural change favored by many conservative judges.
In a recent dissenting opinion seeking to restrict **abortion** rights, Justice Kavanaugh drew a distinction between “facial” challenges to an unconstitutional law and “as applied” challenges. When the Court declares a law to be invalid on its face, the law ceases to operate altogether. Whole Woman’s Health, for example, held that Texas’s admitting privileges law was facially invalid.
When a court strikes down a law as applied to a particular plaintiff, by contrast, that means the law cannot be applied in the specific circumstances that arose in that case. But the state may still be able to enforce the law against other parties who are not before the court.
Kavanaugh suggested that a facial challenge to Louisiana’s TRAP law is not appropriate, and he’s hardly the first member of the Supreme Court to make such a suggestion. Four dissenters drew a similar distinction between facial and as-applied challenges in Casey.
If Kavanaugh gets his way, that would mean that an individual patient challenging an **abortion** restriction would only be able to secure a court order allowing them and them alone to obtain an **abortion**. Imagine, moreover, that Kavanaugh’s rule were also layered on top of a decision holding that providers may no longer challenge anti-**abortion** laws.
The result would be a world where the only way to overcome an unconstitutional **abortion** restriction would be to find a lawyer, file a lawsuit, obtain a court order, receive the **abortion**, and do all of this before the pregnancy became so advanced that it was no longer legal to terminate it. And that’s assuming that **abortion** clinics would continue to operate in a state where the only way for anyone to obtain an **abortion** is to first obtain a court order.
As a practical matter, this world looks virtually identical to one where Roe was explicitly overruled. Wealthy individuals would still be able to fly to another state — or, if necessary, to another country — to obtain an **abortion**. But patients who lack the means or the job flexibility to travel to a distant clinic would be trapped.
The Supreme Court’s opinion in June Medical will most likely be handed down in late June. When that decision does come down, there’s no guarantee that it will overrule Roe. The decision could rest on complicated procedural grounds, and it may not immediately be clear what the decision means for people seeking an **abortion**.
But the decision could very well be a disaster for **abortion** rights even if the Court claims that it is leaving Roe in place. There are many ways to eliminate the constitutional right to an **abortion** without explicitly overruling Roe."
2018-07-05 19:51:09,nbcnews.com,8.454628,Lean Left,Abortion in the U.S.: Five key facts,"**Abortion** has hit the front burner of American political discussion again with the announcement by Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy that he will resign, and President Donald Trump’s promise to nominate a replacement next week.
Kennedy was the swing vote on several key **abortion** rights rulings, including the 1992 case known as Planned Parenthood v. Casey that found states may not impose an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to **abortion**.
Now, opponents of **abortion** rights hope Trump will appoint a justice who would swing the court away from supporting women's access to **abortion**.
Here are a few facts about **abortion** in the U.S.:
Most Americans support **abortion** rights
Surveys show that most Americans support a woman’s right to have an **abortion**. Last month, the latest survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 67 percent of those polled supported Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that supported **abortion** rights under the constitutional right to privacy. The issue is highly partisan, the survey found. About half — 53 percent — of people who said they were Republican would like to see Roe v. Wade overturned, while 81 percent of Democrats and 73 percent of independents want it to stand.
A 2013 NBCNews/Wall Street Journal poll found that 54 percent of Americans believed **abortion** should be legal all or most of the time and 70 percent supported Roe v. Wade.
In 2013, 89 percent of abortions occured in the first 12 weeks. Guttmacher Institute
Legal **abortion** is safe
Opponents of legal **abortion** use a variety of arguments to discourage women from having them or to make it more difficult to provide them. Texas has some of the strongest laws, requiring clinics to meet stringent requirements that legislators say would protect the health of women seeking abortions.
Kennedy was the swing vote in a 2016 Supreme Court decision striking down a Texas law that would have required **abortion** clinics to meet the same standard as ambulatory surgical centers. Medical experts overwhelmingly said such regulations were unnecessary. Earlier this year, the National Academy of Medicine reported that **abortion** care is safe in the U.S. It found that abortions can be safely provided in clinics and doctor’s offices.
Fewer than 1 percent of first-trimester abortions lead to complications, one review found.
“The risk of death associated with childbirth is approximately 14 times higher than that with **abortion**,” the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) says.
Studies have also debunked the argument that abortions raise the risk of depression or breast cancer.
Yet states still seek to restrict access to abortions. According to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies women’s reproductive health, 29 states impose “major” restrictions on **abortion** access.
Banning **abortion** does not reduce it
Countries that restrict **abortion** the most have the highest rates of **abortion**, the Guttmacher Institute found. ""The **abortion** rate is 37 per 1,000 women in countries that prohibit **abortion** altogether or allow it only to save a woman’s life, and 34 per 1,000 in countries that allow **abortion** without restriction as to reason — a difference that is not significant,"" Guttmacher said in a report issued in March.
“Historical and contemporary data show that where **abortion** is illegal or highly restricted, women resort to unsafe means to end an unwanted pregnancy, including self-inflicted abdominal and bodily trauma, ingestion of dangerous chemicals, self-medication with a variety of drugs, and reliance on unqualified **abortion** providers,” ACOG says. “Today, approximately 21 million women around the world obtain unsafe, illegal abortions each year.”
In the U.S. before Roe v. Wade, ACOG says an estimated 1.2 million U.S. women got illegal abortions every year, and says unsafe abortions killed as many as 5,000 of them. “After the Supreme Court ruling, mortality due to septic illegal **abortion** decreased precipitously,” ACOG said.
Providing free birth control does reduce **abortion** rates
Colorado provides a real-life experiment on whether providing safe, effective, long-acting birth control can reduce unwanted pregnancies and abortions. The state’s Department of Public Health and Environment got private funding in 2008 for a program to provide long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), such as IUDs and hormone implants, to low-income women for little or no cost.
Trends in **abortion** between 1997 and 2014 Guttmacher Institute
“The Colorado Family Planning Initiative helped cut the **abortion** rate nearly in half for women aged 15-19 and by 18 percent for women aged 20-24,” the department said in a 2017 report. “Between 2009 and 2014, birth and **abortion** rates both declined by nearly 50 percent among teens aged 15-19 and by 20 percent among young women aged 20-24.”
**Abortion** is very common in the U.S.
“In the United States, where one half of all pregnancies are unintended, almost one third of women will seek an **abortion** by age 45,” ACOG says.
A 2016 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 45 percent of all pregnancies among U.S. women in 2011 were unintended, and 42 percent of them these unintended pregnancies ended in **abortion**.
According to the Guttmacher Institute, 19 percent of pregnancies ended in **abortion** in 2014, a total of 926,200 abortions. That was down 12 percent from 2011. The 2014 **abortion** rate of 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women was the lowest rate ever measured. In 1973, the rate was 16.3 abortions per 1,000 women, aged 15 to 44."
2013-11-12 11:00:45,motherjones.com,10.67031,Left,MAP: Is Your State Ready for Climate Disasters?,"Whether it’s wildfires in the West, drought in the Midwest, or sea level rise on the Eastern seaboard, chances are good your state is in for its own breed of **climate**-related disasters. Every state is required to file a State Hazard Mitigation Plan with FEMA, which lays out risks for that state and its protocols for handling catastrophe. But as a new analysis from Columbia University’s Center for **Climate** **Change** Law reveals, many states’ plans do not take **climate** **change** into account.
Michael Gerrard, the Center’s director, said his team combed through all 50 reports to see how accurately and comprehensively **climate** **change** was taken into consideration, if at all, and grouped them into four ranked categories:
No discussion of **climate** **change** or inaccurate discussion of **climate** **change**. Minimal mention of **climate** **change** related issues. Accurate but limited discussion of **climate** **change** and/or brief discussion with acknowledgement of need for future inclusion. Thorough discussion of **climate** **change** impacts on hazards and **climate** adaptation actions.
While FEMA itself acknowledged this summer that **climate** **change** could increase areas at risk from flooding by 45 percent overt the next century, states are not required to discuss **climate** **change** in their mitigation plans. The Columbia analysis didn’t take into account **climate** planning outside the scope of the mitigation plans, like state-level greenhouse gas limits or renewable energy incentives. And as my colleague Kate Sheppard reported, some government officials have avoided using **climate** science terminology even in plans that implicitly address **climate** risks; states that didn’t use terms like “**climate** **change**” and “global warming” in their mitigation plans were docked points in Columbia’s ranking algorithm.
Gerrard said he wasn’t surprised to find more attention paid to **climate** **change** in coastal states like Alaska and New York that are closest to the front lines. But he was surprised to find that a plurality of states landed in the least-prepared category, suggesting a need, he said, for better communication of non-coastal risks like drought and heat waves.
“We had hoped that more of the states would have dealt with [**climate** **change**] in a more forthright way,” he said."
2019-06-14 08:00:00,vox.com,10.637846,Lean Left,Why the Democratic Party doesn’t want a presidential debate about climate change,"The first Democratic presidential debates are this week, with 20 contenders for the White House lined up across two nights.
**Climate** **change** is likely to come up, given the venue, Miami, a city where **climate** **change** is already threatening coastal properties and where even Republicans want to tax carbon dioxide emissions.
For Democratic primary voters, the **climate** crisis has rocketed up the polls and is now a top-tier issue. A CNN survey this month found that three-quarters of Iowa Democratic caucus participants said that their candidate must treat **climate** **change** as the greatest threat to humanity.
But environmental campaigners like Greenpeace and the Sunrise Movement don’t just want questions about **climate** **change** during the debates; they want a whole debate event centered on the issue. Several Democratic presidential candidates agree. A group called 314 Action has even pledged $100,000 to host the debate.
The Democratic National Committee, however, isn’t swayed. Earlier this month, Tom Perez, head of the DNC, ruled out an official presidential primary debate centered on **climate** **change** in a post on Medium. Perez said that **climate** **change** is just one of several high-priority topics, and that it would be unfair to host a debate revolving around it, particularly when one candidate, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, has centered his entire campaign on the issue.
If we **change** our guidelines at the request of one candidate who has made **climate** **change** their campaign’s signature issue, how do we say no to the numerous other requests we’ve had? How do we say no to other candidates in the race who may request debates focused on an issue they’ve made central to their own campaigns?
But the fact that a senior party official had to shoot down a **climate** debate shows just how much more active voters are around **climate** **change** in this election, especially compared to previous cycles.
Environmental activists were displeased with Perez’s pronouncement. On Tuesday, protesters again gathered at the DNC headquarters in Washington to continue to pressure the committee to hold a **climate** **change** debate.

And it’s not just one Democratic presidential contender that wants a **climate** **change** debate; it’s 15, including the frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden.

The debate over the debate is ultimately a microcosm of the different approaches Democrats are weighing to tackle **climate** **change**: as the tentpole of their agenda or as an element of every policy.
**Climate** **change** is long overdue for a prime-time discussion
The consequences of increasing average temperatures, rising seas, more rainfall and heat waves, and drier forests that fuel wildfires have already proved to be costly and deadly. Yet for years, **climate** **change** received conspicuously little attention in these televised events for presidential candidates. In 2016, the presidential debates almost completely ignored **climate** **change**. It’s a surprising omission, especially since questions about **climate** **change** in presidential and vice presidential debates date back decades.
Now **climate** **change** is a high priority for Democratic voters and elected officials. Some of the strongest activist energy in this election cycle is targeted at limiting greenhouse gases through proposals like the Green New Deal.
“A lot has changed over the past few years as **climate** **change** has increasingly become a voting issue,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) told Vox in an email. “The DNC is deservedly feeling pressure to do a far better job on **climate** than in the last primary debates.”
So a presidential **climate** **change** debate would be a strong step toward correcting this imbalance in attention. Former New York Times environmental reporter Justin Gillis argued that such an event would not just be a messaging exercise but a useful way to test a candidate’s mettle for the job with a real-world crisis:
All the candidates want to curb fossil fuel emissions, but there is far from a consensus on how to do it. Should nuclear power be part of the solution? A tax on carbon emissions? Tougher regulations? The candidates disagree. Let’s hear what they have to say. If we do, we’ll also see which candidate, under competitive pressure, displays the rhetorical skills the party needs to make this a winning issue in a national election. If the DNC continues with this ludicrous position of stamping out **climate** discussion in the primaries, we’ll never find out.
One of the first and biggest proponents of a **climate** **change** debate is Inslee. He’s made **climate** **change** the overarching theme of his campaign. A **climate** debate would likely put the lesser-known candidate at center stage, and he’s not too pleased with the DNC’s resistance to such an event.

But other Democratic candidates for president have called for such a debate as well, including Bernie Sanders, Beto O’Rourke, and Elizabeth Warren.
Democratic party leaders don’t think a **climate** debate is useful or necessary
The argument over whether or not to hold a **climate** **change** debate is a central question in a larger discussion among Democrats over how to combat **climate** **change**. Should it be the centerpiece of policy-making, or should **climate** considerations be an element of other issues of concern?
We’re seeing this play out in how Inslee’s **climate** strategy compares to that of Warren. In the proposals she’s released so far, Warren has addressed **climate** **change** through her plans for public lands, domestic manufacturing, and the military.
So do Democrats really need a **climate** debate, or can **climate** **change** be adequately addressed in other policy discussions? Perez said that even without a **climate** **change**-specific debate, it will be an issue that’s impossible to ignore. “I have the utmost confidence that, based on our conversations with networks, **climate** **change** will be discussed early and often during our party’s primary debates,” he wrote.
And while there are a lot of things to discuss about how to fight **climate** **change**, almost all Democrats agree on the fundamentals, namely that the United States will have to zero-out its greenhouse gas emissions by at least the middle of the century, if not sooner. Many contenders have also pledged to refuse money from fossil fuel interests.
Meanwhile, Democratic presidential candidates, including Inslee, Biden, Warren, Beto O’Rourke, and Michael Bennet have all taken the initiative to offer their own **climate** policies. It’s likely more candidates will put out their own proposals or sign on to one of the existing plans. And as Robinson Meyer pointed out at the Atlantic, it’s clear that the Green New Deal has lifted the floor for what passes as an acceptable **climate** policy for Democrats. So any debate among Democrats on **climate** policy would scarcely illuminate the small and shrinking divides among the two dozen presidential hopefuls.
“Whoever becomes the Democratic nominee will have the most serious **climate** **change** proposal and policy plans ever in American history,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former **climate** adviser to President Bill Clinton and a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute.
He added that centering a debate entirely on **climate** **change** could carry a political cost. “To somehow make a fetish of **climate** **change** as the sine qua non of the 2020 election would in fact fall into a trap which the Republicans are trying to create, which is a view of Democrats as concerned only about non-pocketbook issues,” Bledsoe said. “I applaud the DNC for having the political common sense not to have a debate devoted to a single topic, whatever the topic.”
The DNC has created a long list of rules to govern who qualifies for the debate stage, setting thresholds for polling and fundraising. (Vox’s Andrew Prokop put together an excellent explainer about Democratic debate rules.) Among the rules is that a candidate who appears at an unofficial debate will be barred from the official debates. So even if a candidate decides to create their own debate event, be it about the **climate** crisis or otherwise, they stand to be excluded from the main stage (**climate** **change** “forums” and “town halls” are still permitted).
Ultimately, debates are theater. They may only move poll numbers by small amounts, and their perception is shaped often as much by media coverage as the contents of the debates themselves. A meaningful **climate** policy debate could still be had without a two-hour block of exclusive airtime."

All this is geared to a conference in Paris next year, at which specific **climate** **change** agreements are to be endorsed.
But recent efforts, such as 2009's meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, have left promises broken and documents unsigned, and raises the question of how much will get done. ""The politics for **climate** **change** are so toxic,"" said Doreen Stabinsky, a professor at the College of the Atlantic and an expert in **climate** **change** politics. Read MoreObama on **Climate** **Change**: 'We Need to Act' ""It's hard to step into the international space when many countries, like the U.S., have trouble agreeing at home on what to do,"" she explained. Stabinsky said that making a strong commitment to **climate** **change** efforts is difficult for many nations because they would have to admit responsibility for **climate** **change**, something she said that many countries are loath to do. There's also being able to agree on what plans should be implemented, said Lynn Wilson, academic chair at Kaplan University and who serves on the **climate** **change** delegation for the United Nations. ""We're not talking to the average farmer about what's best for them,"" she argued. ""There's a lot of divisions over **climate** **change** and we still have to come to agreement on common goals.""
Costs to fight **climate** **change**
The UN says that **climate** **change** increases risk and stress to water, sewer, food supplies, the world's forests, drainage and transportation systems as well as infrastructure. That's because ""these systems are more exposed to the impact of increasingly powerful hurricanes, typhoons and other natural disasters."" But the cost to avoid severe weather events won't be cheap.
There are various estimates but switching from fossil fuels to low-carbon sources of energy will cost $44 trillion between now and 2050, according to a report released last May by the International Energy Agency. A UN report from the Intergovernmental Panel on **Climate** **Change** last April said that efforts to stabilize levels of greenhouse-gas emissions would require investments of about $13 trillion through 2030. But a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences estimates that damages from uncontrolled **climate** **change**—an increase of 3.4 degree celsius—could cost $12 trillion or 2.8 percent of global output by 2095.
And delaying action could increase costs by 40 percent every decade, making it ever more costly to do what what's needed. That's causing some in the financial world to start looking at **climate** **change** in a different light, said Paula DiPerna, a special adviser, to the Carbon Disclosure Project, an environmental risk management firm.
""Banks are shying away from companies who don't know how to manage their **climate** **change** risk,"" she said. ""And companies are getting better returns on equity over time for investing in green technology."" It's the bottom line that's creating a bigger response to **climate** **change**, said Mark Kenber, CEO of The **Climate** Group, a non-profit environmental organization that works with business and government partners. Read MoreInvesting in **climate** **change**: A 25-stock index ""I think the **climate** **change** fight will accelerate going forward,"" he said. ""We're seeing countries and companies going beyond just thinking about going green as it's more economical to do so now."" But Kaplan University's Wilson said that it ""can't just be all about the money."" Wilson said that calls for increased financial investments in areas such as crop insurance and green energy projects shouldn't come at the expense of strategies like teaching farmers in drought-ridden areas how to plant crops that use less water.
Pledges made
Sincere or not, some countries and businesses are taking bigger steps against **climate** **change**. Forty companies, including Kellogg, L'Oreal and Nestle signed a declaration this week pledging to cut tropical deforestation by half in 2020, and to stop it completely by 2030. Some 1,000 businesses and investors signaled their support for pricing carbon, to cut greenhouse emissions, in a declaration published by the World Bank Group, It was also signed by 73 countries.
Apple CEO Tim Cook told reporters this week, the tech firm's new headquarters currently under construction in Cupertino, California, will be ""one of the greenest buildings on the planet."" In his speech on Tuesday, President Obama said **climate** **change** is not just an ""urgent and growing threat"" but is ""the most important and consequential issue of the 21st Century."" Read More10 countries that may be hit hard by **climate** **change**
Obama listed steps his administration has taken to stop **climate** **change**, such as promoting tougher fuel efficiency standards. He also said he wants to cut American greenhouse emissions. That's not enough for Kaplan University's Wilson. ""Germany is leading the way on **climate** **change** efforts,"" she said. ""The U.S. is still one of the most powerful countries, and if we want to retain that position it's best for us to lead.""

2019-01-18 14:50:00,vox.com,10.607182,Lean Left,"The State Department needs to quit ignoring climate change, GAO says","Researchers, aid groups, and diplomats have been warning for years that **climate** **change** is a key driver behind the growing global crisis of migration and displacement.
The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reported that there were 24.2 million people displaced by **climate** and weather disasters in 2016. Last year, the World Bank estimated that number would rise to 143 million people by the middle of the century if **climate** **change** is left unchecked.
These mass movements can in turn threaten fragile governments and economies, potentially leading to conflicts. Rising sea levels, drought, more severe weather, and extreme heat are already fueling famines and creating refugees.

And the consequences can ripple back to the United States. “The worsening of **climate** **change** effects around the world, particularly in low-income countries, may increase the number of people wanting to immigrate to the United States,” the Government Accountability Office wrote in a report released Thursday.
But the US State Department has been alarmingly lax in addressing how rising temperatures are fueling human movements around the world, according to the GAO. By overlooking **climate** **change**, the agency may be unprepared to handle events that impact US security.
“The State Department has dropped the ball on providing [**climate** **change**] guidance to its missions,” said David Gootnick, director of international affairs and trade at the GAO. “We recommended that they build that guidance back in.”
Shortly after taking office, Trump rescinded a 2016 presidential memorandum on **climate** **change** and national security as well as a 2013 executive order requiring federal agencies to prepare for the impacts of **climate** **change**.
But one Obama-era **climate** action remains in place: Executive Order 13677 signed in 2014 directs federal agencies to incorporate **climate** **change** and resilience planning into international development work. This affects the State Department as well as the United States Agency for International Development.
As the GAO report points out, these agencies are still required by the White House to address how **climate** **change** will impact their work. And if they don’t, they stand to be ill prepared to cope with humanitarian disasters and migrations that affect millions of people.
**Climate** **change** has started to affect diplomacy but the State Department isn’t giving its people on the ground the guidance they need
In 2017, Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein (CA), Sheldon Whitehouse (RI), Jeff Merkley (OR), Elizabeth Warren (MA), and Ed Markey (MA) requested that the GAO look into how the government is addressing the impacts of **climate** **change** on migration in light of the Trump administration’s retreat on **climate** policy.
The government watchdog examined how this was playing out the Department of Defense, USAID, and the State Department, the agencies on the front lines. While the Defense Department isn’t covered by EO 13677, it continues to incorporate **climate** **change** into its planning. Military and intelligence officials, including those appointed by Trump, have long identified **climate** **change** as a threat multiplier.
On Thursday, the Defense Department sent its own report to Congress on how **climate** **change** would impact its operations in compliance with the National Defense Authorization Act. “The effects of a changing **climate** are a national security issue with potential impacts to Department of Defense missions, operational plans, and installations,” according to the report.

However, the State Department is giving **climate** **change** less attention than it used to. “State changed its approach in 2017, no longer providing missions with guidance on whether and how to include **climate** **change** risks in their integrated country strategies,” GAO wrote in its report.
The Trump administration in its budget requests to Congress also zeroed out funding for many of the State Department’s **climate** programs, including the Global **Climate** **Change** Initiative and the United Nations Green **Climate** Fund.
“This is a manifestation of the shift in priorities on **climate** **change**,” Gootnick said.
He explained that prior to the Trump administration, the State Department **climate** **change** impacts on migration was a key element in much of the agency’s work with other countries. This included work with the UN Global Compact on Migration, which is shaping up to be the first comprehensive international agreement on international migration. The United States announced in 2017 it would withdraw from the negotiations for the agreement.
Work on other activities like helping small island countries adapt to rising sea levels and migrate away from high-risk areas also stalled after the **change** in administrations. The GAO found that **climate** **change** risks would impact the State Department’s development assistance work. Of the three agencies GAO examined in this report, the State Department lagged furthest behind in complying with White House directives on **climate** **change**.
Without a clear agenda on **climate** **change**, the State Department could miss critical risks and threats that could affect the movement of populations around the world. Failing to address how factors like rising average temperatures increase the risk of crop failures could leave diplomats unprepared for the ensuing migrations.
For its part, the State Department wasn’t hostile to the GAO’s findings. “The Department does not oppose this recommendation,” the State Department wrote in its response to the GAO report, adding that the agency will update its guidance documents to its missions by June to incorporate issues like **climate** resilience. However, the agency also said they will also start examining whether to recommend that the White House rescind EO 136777.
“It’s an unusual response,” Gootnick said."
2019-01-28 15:20:00,vox.com,10.592082,Lean Left,Climate change polls: Americans are more worried about climate change,"Several recent polls show that people in the United States are increasingly alarmed about **climate** **change**.
According to a nationally representative survey from Yale University and George Mason University, 69 percent of Americans are “somewhat worried” about **climate** **change** and 29 percent are “very worried.” These are the highest values since the surveys began in 2008, and the “very worried” category shows an 8 percent jump compared to the previous survey published in April 2018.
“We’ve never seen that happen before,” said co-author Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on **Climate** **Change** Communication. “My read of it is that basically, people are more convinced that it’s happening and more convinced that it’s human-caused.”
Similarly, a national Reuters/Ipsos poll from December found that 72 percent of Americans consider **climate** **change** to be a moderate, serious, or imminent threat.
A big reason for the growing concern is that many of the consequences of **climate** **change** have become impossible to ignore in recent years. The United States saw billions of dollars in damages and dozens of deaths last year as rising temperatures increased the damages from extreme events. These disasters helped make the somewhat abstract warming of the planet tangible in people’s minds.
“You can experience, a drought, flood, or hurricane, but you can’t experience global temperatures going up,” Leiserowitz said.
The findings echo yet another national poll from the University of Chicago and the Associated Press this month that found that 71 percent of Americans understand that the **climate** is changing, and a majority know that humans are driving it. Forty-eight percent of Americans say they are more convinced by **climate** science than they were five years ago, in large part due to their experiences with extreme weather.
But how much of this anxiety has been matched with a willingness to act on **climate** **change**?
That’s a tougher question to answer, but the evidence so far shows that few Americans are changing how they vote, how they act, or how much they’re willing to pay to address the problem.
Polls keep showing that Americans are increasingly concerned about **climate** **change**, but they aren’t willing to do much about it
In theory, a large share of Americans, along with businesses and public officials, support policies to fight **climate** **change**. The University of Chicago/AP poll showed that 44 percent of respondents said they support a carbon tax, 29 percent oppose one, and 25 percent said they neither support nor oppose a carbon tax.
The oil giant Exxon Mobil announced it was backing a proposal to tax carbon emissions last year. Several governors campaigned and won in last year’s midterm elections on their ambitions to promote clean energy and limit emissions. In Congress, lawmakers are building steam for a Green New Deal to fight global warming.
Republicans are increasingly talking about **climate** **change** as well, with some going as far as to advocate a carbon tax. Even Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY), the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee who once said the role of human activity in **climate** **change** was “not known,” is now pushing for an innovation-led approach to limit greenhouse gases.
And then there’s acting Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who has presided over numerous rollbacks and revisions of regulations intended to fight **climate** **change**. At his confirmation hearing earlier this month to take over the agency in a permanent capacity, he said that **climate** **change** was an important and concerning issue for him.
“On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being you stay awake at night worrying about it and 1 being it occasionally crosses your mind, how concerned are you about this devastating impact on our nation and the world?” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) asked Wheeler.
“8 or 9,” Wheeler said.
“Really?” Merkley responded incredulously.
“There has been a rhetorical shift among elected Republicans on **climate** **change**,” said Sam Ori, executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. “What’s driving that, I don’t know.”
However, it’s easy to say you’re worried about **climate** **change** and rhetorically support policies to fight it. Gauging how intense that concern is among the general public and whether it will lead to anything more meaningful is a bigger challenge. Are people genuinely worried, or is it just fashionable to say that **climate** **change** is a problem?
“To me, that’s a really fundamental question,” said Ori.
The AP/University of Chicago poll tried to get at this by asking people how much respondents were willing to pay monthly to fight **climate** **change**. Fifty-seven percent of those surveyed said they would be willing to pay at least $1 per month, 23 percent said they’d pay at least $40 per month, and 16 percent were willing to pay at least $100 per month.
It shows that a minority of the population is willing to pay the majority of the cost for fighting greenhouse gas emissions and coping with rising temperatures.
But that also means that 43 percent of respondents wouldn’t be willing to pay anything to deal with **climate** **change**, a sign of a sharp divide. Ori noted that these differences in the willingness to pay for **climate** **change** are very similar to the team’s findings in their last survey, even though concern about **climate** **change** increased. So even as alarm grows, action lags far behind.
“It’s kind of astonishing,” he said.
The rise in concern about **climate** **change** could be a blip
Robert Brulle, a research professor at Brown University who studies public opinion on the environment but was not involved in these polls, explained that **climate** **change** is rarely a top-tier issue. It’s often subordinate to worries about the economy or ongoing foreign policy concerns.
“In comparison to unemployment? In comparison to terrorism? In comparison to war with North Korea?” said Brulle. “Always, always, always, **climate** **change** comes at the bottom of those comparisons.”
Right now, the US economy is doing well and US war casualties are rarely grabbing headlines, so there’s more room for **climate** **change** in the public consciousness. Brulle noted that before the financial crisis in 2008, we also saw growing alarm about **climate** **change**. “We’ve been here before. We’ve had this level of concern before,” he said.
Concern about **climate** **change** then dipped in the following decade. So it’s unclear whether the current level of worry reflects a more meaningful shift in public opinion, or if it’s a temporary spike that will recede as the vivid memories of recent extreme weather events fade and other anxieties loom larger.
“If we go into a recession and **climate** **change** concern stays up, then fundamentally, something has changed,” Brulle said.
Another factor to consider is that beliefs on **climate** **change** are often closely tied to identities. Ask someone what they think about **climate** **change** and it’s very likely their answer will also reveal what they think about NFL players kneeling during the national anthem, abortion rights, and marginal tax rates. These issues aren’t directly related, yet they’re often packaged together.
That means swaying public opinion on **climate** **change** isn’t simply a matter of informing people about the issue. In fact, research shows that the people most diametrically opposed in their views on **climate** **change** are often the most educated and most informed, and trying to correct myths may entrench opinions even further.
And even when minds **change**, it’s hard to translate that into personal or political shifts. “We call that ‘two-track thinking’,” Brulle said. “People will say on one hand they want action on **climate** **change**, but on the other hand, they behave as if it’s not real.”"
2015-06-02 09:30:03,vox.com,10.590793,Lean Left,8 maps that reveal Americans' incoherent opinions on climate change,"Opinion surveys on **climate** **change** are often reported as national averages, but national opinion is not the most important thing to most politicians. They respond to regional and local opinion, the opinions of their constituents. With that in mind, a 2015 study attempted to map public opinion on **climate** **change** and **climate** policy in geographic detail, down to the level of counties and congressional districts.
Researchers took a look at a large database of information assembled by the Yale Project on **Climate** **Change** Communication, which has done regular surveys on American **climate** opinion since 2007. They attempted to ""downscale"" the data to the local level through, ahem, ""multilevel regression and poststratification."" They then tested the results against independent polls in four states and two cities, to make sure the projections held up.
With those geographically detailed estimates in hand, the researchers made a fascinating interactive tool that shows opinion on various **climate** questions by national average, state, congressional district, or county. For the maps below, I show county-level data, which is the most granular.
Let's have a look at what Americans think about **climate** **change** and **climate** policy.
1) Most Americans believe the **climate** is changing
Unsurprisingly, belief that the **climate** is changing is concentrated on the West Coast and the Northeast, along with a few other urban areas. But modest majorities in almost every county believe the atmosphere is warming. Good news, right? Except ...
2) Not even half of Americans believe humans are responsible
This is the more relevant question when it comes to policy. If human carbon dioxide emissions are not responsible for global warming, then there's no reason to reduce human carbon dioxide emissions. Though scientists are 95 percent certain humans are the dominant influence on recent **climate** **change**, majorities believe that only in a few coastal and urban areas.
3) Even fewer Americans believe there's a scientific consensus on **climate** **change**
Here's a puzzler: more people believe **climate** **change** is happening than believe that scientists believe **climate** **change** is happening. Why, Americans? For whatever reason, it appears the long effort to push the consensus message has not been very successful. (Worth noting: the consensus message is true.)
4) Fewer than half of Americans believe **climate** **change** is hurting the US now
For years, environmentalists have worked to connect extreme weather events to **climate** **change**. It appears that message has not swayed most of the country (perhaps because the media refuses to help). However...
5) Most Americans believe **climate** **change** will harm future generations
Most Americans view **climate** **change** as a real but distant problem, something that will harm their descendants. That is not a recipe for political urgency.
Nonetheless, opinions on **climate** policy are interesting. For example:
6) Everybody loves renewable energy
This is the strongest public consensus of all. Americans love renewable energy. They want to research it, subsidize it, support it, mandate it, whatever it takes, even in Kansas. Across demographic and partisan lines, they love it.
7) Everybody loves limiting carbon emissions
Here's another puzzler for you: more people support regulating CO2 as a pollutant than believe humans are causing **climate** **change**. Who are the people who support regulating it but don't believe it causes **climate** **change**? And why? It's inert and harmless, except for the **climate** thing.
The answer, I'm guessing, is that people don't understand **climate** **change** very well. (This is the answer to all the puzzlers, basically.) When people hear ""pollutant,"" they want less of it. Nonetheless, it does represent fertile terrain for **climate** policy, unlike ...
8) Support for a carbon tax remains low, even when the revenue is refunded
Generally, the public's policy preferences are the opposite of economists'. The public likes directly subsidizing clean energy and directly limiting pollutants, policies that hide costs from consumers. It doesn't like gas taxes or carbon taxes, policies that make costs transparent.
Also: note that despite the fervent hopes and predictions of ""tax and dividend"" supporters, the promise to refund the tax revenue back to households doesn't do much increase support for a tax. People just don't believe it will happen.
TL;DR
Americans don't understand **climate** **change** very well, but they see it as a long-term threat and support policies to address it — just not the policies wonks want them to support."
2015-12-07 15:39:36,motherjones.com,10.583193,Left,Bernie Sanders Calls for a Carbon Tax,"Let our journalists help you make sense of the noise: Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter and get a recap of news that matters.
This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the **Climate** Desk collaboration.
Bernie Sanders will unveil a sweeping new plan to fight **climate** **change** on Monday, calling for a carbon tax and an ambitious 40 percent cut in carbon emissions by 2030 to speed the transition to a greener economy.
The Democratic presidential candidate will use the crunch week of the **climate** **change** meeting in Paris to try to upstage rivals Hillary Clinton and Martin O’Malley, releasing a 16-page plan aimed at showcasing his green credentials.
The plan goes beyond Barack Obama’s **climate** pledges, which aim to match the European Union in ambition by calling for a 40 percent cut in carbon emissions by 2030 on 1990 levels, according to a copy of the plan seen by the Guardian. The 1990 starting point is a more demanding target than the current US baseline of 2005.
Sanders will also call for a carbon tax, big investments in energy-saving technologies and renewable power sources, and promise to create 10 million clean energy jobs.
The **climate** meeting in Paris has attracted an unusual level of attention compared with earlier meetings, as Democrats and Republicans gear up for the first votes in the presidential primaries just over a month away.
A group of 10 Democratic senators flew to Paris to reassure the international community they would defend Obama’s **climate** plan. In Washington, meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have tried to block a global **climate** deal by trying to repeal Obama’s plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants.
Sanders’ plan – which will be released as talks aimed at reaching a global agreement to fight **climate** **change** kick into a higher gear – will feature the Vermont senator’s “take-no-prisoners” approach to the fossil fuel industry and **climate** deniers in Congress.
He will call for banning fossil fuel lobbyists from the White House, and ending subsidies to fossil fuel companies.
“Bernie will tax polluters causing the **climate** crisis, and return billions of dollars to working families to ensure the fossil fuel companies don’t subject us to unfair rate hikes. Bernie knows that **climate** **change** will not affect everyone equally,” the plan will say. “The carbon tax will also protect those most impacted by the transformation of our energy system and protect the most vulnerable communities in the country suffering the ravages of **climate** **change**.”
Sanders will also promise to keep the pressure on industry for spreading misinformation about **climate** **change**, saying he will bring **climate** deniers to justice.
“It is an embarrassment that Republican politicians, with few exceptions, refuse to even recognize the reality of **climate** **change**, let alone are prepared to do anything about it. The reality is that the fossil fuel industry is to blame for much of the **climate** **change** skepticism in America,” the plan will say.
And Sanders will not back away from his assertions about **climate** **change** as a security threat—despite ridicule from Republican presidential contenders.
“The reality is that the fossil fuel industry is to blame for much of the **climate** **change** skepticism in America.”
“**Climate** **change** is the single greatest threat facing our planet,” the plan will say.
Sanders’s call for a ban on new offshore oil drilling and fossil fuel projects on public lands won praise from groups such as Greenpeace and 350.org which have campaigned to keep coal, oil and gas in the ground to prevent dangerous **climate** **change**.
“He has broken free of the corporate and 1 percent money that has held back **climate** policy for far too long,” Annie Leonard, director of Greenpeace US, said in an emailed statement.
The plan appeared to be an attempt to regain ground lost to Clinton, as she took more ambitious positions on **climate** **change**.
Sanders was stung in November when the League of Conservation Voters delivered an early endorsement of Clinton – even though he scored far higher than the secretary of state in the campaign group’s green ranking score card.
Since the start of the campaign, the three Democratic presidential contenders have tried to outdo one another on their commitment to fighting **climate** **change** —making a striking contrast with Republican presidential candidates who deny **climate** **change** is occurring.
All three Democratic candidates have promised more ambitious **climate** actions than Obama.
O’Malley was the first off the blocks, unveiling his **climate** agenda in June in an opinion piece in USA Today, and continues to claim the strongest position by calling for a complete phase-out of fossil fuels by 2050.
Clinton meanwhile has slowly edged towards a stronger position on **climate** **change** as the campaign progressed, belatedly coming out against the controversial Keystone XL pipeline and hunting for oil in Arctic waters. She moved to outflank Obama on his renewable energy plan by calling for the US to get 33 percent of its electricity from clean energy by 2027.
**Climate** **change** occupies a far higher profile in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries than earlier contests—in part because of Obama’s focus on the environment in his second term in the White House.
Democratic operatives see **climate** **change** as a potential wedge issue—a chance to paint Republicans as anti-science and out-of-touch for rejecting the science behind **climate** **change**."
2018-12-05 11:30:18,edition.cnn.com,10.580077,?,"Tackling climate change could save millions of lives, report says","(CNN) **Climate** studies often pinpoint the detrimental public health impacts related to rising atmospheric temperatures, extreme weather events and other consequences of a changing **climate**.
Meeting the commitments of the 2015 Paris **climate** agreement could save millions of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars by the middle of the century, according to the report.
Meeting the goals put forth in the Paris agreement would be expected to save more than 1 million lives a year from air pollution alone by 2050, it says. Drivers of **climate** **change**, principally fossil fuel combustion, contribute to about 7 million deaths worldwide from outdoor and indoor air pollution annually, according to the report.
The Paris Agreement is a pledge among representatives from countries around the world to take action against **climate** **change**, specifically by reducing their nations' carbon output and halting global warming below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The United States pledged to withdraw from the landmark agreement last year.
Global leaders and officials are now gathering for two weeks of meetings at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on **Climate** **Change**, or COP24, to create a rulebook that will turn the Paris **climate** agreement into a workable reality. They aim to establish rules, figure out financing and build ways to verify that nations are meeting their commitments.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for action Monday in Poland, telling gathered delegates that ""we are in deep trouble with **climate** **change**.""
What needs to be done
The new WHO report, launched at the COP24, is based on contributions from more than 80 health professionals, academic experts and representatives of civil society and international agencies who have worked on **climate** **change** and public health for more than three decades.
""The most direct link between **climate** **change** and ill health is air pollution,"" the authors wrote.
""Burning fossil fuels for power, transport and industry is the main source of the carbon emissions that are driving **climate** **change** and a major contributor to health-damaging air pollution, which every year kills over seven million people due to exposure inside and outside their homes,"" according to the report.
The report provides recommendations for governments on how to tackle the issue of **climate** **change**.
Those recommendations include identifying and promoting actions to reduce both carbon emissions and air pollution; mobilizing mayors and other subnational leaders to promote **climate** goals; engaging the health community in addressing **climate** **change**; and systematically tracking progress in health from such **climate** **change** mitigation.
The report referenced an analysis showing that the value of the health gains from meeting the targets of the Paris **climate** agreement would be approximately twice the cost of the policies.
General **climate** **change**-related health impacts named in the report include in the areas of mental illness, undernutrition, injuries, respiratory disease, allergies, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases, poisoning, waterborne diseases and heatstroke.
Only about 3% of health resources are invested in the prevention of **climate** **change**-related impacts, and only about 0.5% of multilateral **climate** funds have been dispersed specifically for health projects, according to the report.
'This isn't just a story about threats; it's a story about benefits'
The new WHO report is the fourth in the past two months to warn of the detrimental health impacts of **climate** **change**, said Dr. Mona Sarfaty, executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on **Climate** and Health and director of the program on **climate** and health at George Mason University's Center for **Climate** **Change** Communication . She was not involved in the report.

In October, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on **Climate** **Change** said in a report that the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.
Then, in November, a separate report called The Lancet Countdown on Health and **Climate** **Change** showed how extreme heat from **climate** **change** already has been affecting productivity, food supply and disease transmission worldwide.
Also last month, the US government's National **Climate** Assessment warned that the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century due to **climate** **change**-related impacts.
The new WHO report comes with a message that ""addressing **climate** **change** is an area of opportunity. It will improve our health, it will save money, and it will also stimulate economic development, because people who are healthier are able to be more productive,"" Sarfaty said. ""The other reports share this message of possibility and potential for benefit.""
As for the Paris Agreement, ""there's no question that if we meet those goals, we'll save lives, and we will decrease the burden on the health delivery system, which will mean that people won't face as much poor health and won't end up in the hospital as frequently. Both -- that saving of lives and of health care services -- will save us money. So we save lives, we improve health, and we save money,"" she said.

The drivers of **climate** **change** -- such as fossil fuel burning and large-scale livestock production -- are already posing a burden on public health, through air pollution and effects on respiratory and heart conditions, said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a professor of public health sciences and director of the Environmental Health Sciences Center at UC Davis Health , who was not involved in the new report but has been studying the effects of recent wildfires in California on human health.
The air pollution from the California wildfires has big implications for the health of millions of people in the area. For instance, ""after the 2017 Northern California fires were out -- Sonoma and Napa were two of the counties -- survivors who did not have a pre-existing respiratory condition were reporting respiratory symptoms still six months out,"" Hertz-Picciotto said.

""One of the main -- and critical -- messages in this report is that you can't really separate **climate** changes from health -- both in the short-run and the long-run."""
2014-08-05 10:00:10,buzzfeednews.com,10.57747,?,White House To West: Climate Change Is Making Wildfires More Frequent And Worse,"WASHINGTON — Americans living in fear of — and dealing with the aftermath from — deadly wildfires are suffering the effects of **climate** **change**, the Obama administration said Tuesday in the newest iteration of the White House push to discuss **climate** **change** as a clear and present danger rather than a future threat.
It's a strategy top White House officials said last week is changing some Republican minds on **climate** **change**, albeit not any of the ones who cast votes on legislation in Congress.
The latest iteration of the messaging strategy focuses on wildfire season. On Tuesday, the White House plans to launch a digital campaign that ties the wildfire threat directly to **climate** **change** and urges Americans to pressure Washington to take legislative action. Administration officials gave BuzzFeed an early look at the campaign Monday.
Top White House adviser John Podesta penned an email for the White House list scheduled for Tuesday morning that ties the ongoing wildfire emergency in California to **climate** **change**.
""In the western United States, changes in our **climate** are fueling wildfire seasons that are longer and more intense, putting people, communities, and businesses at risk,"" reads the email. ""As we're seeing right now, wildfires unquestionably have devastating impacts on the lives of many Americans.""
President Obama's Science Adviser, Dr. John Holdren, stars in a new White House video meant to illustrate the connection between **climate** **change** and wildfires. In the video, Holdren says that while ""no single wildfire can be said to have been caused by **climate** **change**,"" shifting environmental conditions make them more frequent and harder to combat.
Holdren has become the face of the new White House **climate** efforts, deflecting **climate** **change** critics' contention in a January video that the Polar Vortex disproved **climate** **change**. Holdren was also the face on the administration's May **Climate** Assessment, which found ongoing impacts of **climate** **change** across the country."
2018-10-29 13:50:01,vox.com,10.576891,Lean Left,2018 midterm elections: how candidates compare on climate change,"This group is helping voters make sense of which candidates take **climate** **change** seriously
Share All sharing options for: This group is helping voters make sense of which candidates take **climate** **change** seriously
**Climate** **change**, a major threat to the United States, has become impossible to ignore this election season, and is finding its way into midterm debates, along with gun violence, health care, and immigration.
In places like Florida, the devastation wrought by Hurricane Michael placed the consequences of the warming world front and center in the minds of many voters. And earlier this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on **Climate** **Change** warned that the world may have as little as 12 years to limit warming this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
At the same time, clean energy is booming, but many states are seeing a concerted push to roll back **climate** policies and to boost fossil fuels.
Yet despite mounting concerns about **climate**, there aren’t a whole lot of tools out there to help voters figure out where candidates actually stand on **climate** **change** and related issues.
A group called Vote **Climate** US PAC has taken a stab at this. They put together a **climate** **change** voter’s guide for House and Senate races, ranking what candidates in House and Senate races have said and plan to do about rising average temperatures.
Karyn Strickler, president of Vote **Climate** US PAC, told Vox that what’s unique about her guide is not only that it focuses on **climate** **change**, but that it scores both incumbents and challengers. (The PAC, she added, is not funded by any billionaires but “a few small funders who care” but did not say whom.)
For incumbents, the guide scores their votes on **climate**-related bills, their stated positions on **climate** **change**, any leadership roles they’ve taken on the issue, and their position on a carbon price.
Challengers, who may not have a voting record on **climate** **change**, are graded on their views of **climate** **change** and their position on a carbon price.
From there, the group calculates a score for each candidate. Looking at current officeholders, the results are not surprising. Here are the senators with perfect scores:
And here are the zeroes:
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), for example, voted against an amendment on a bill to price carbon emissions and voted for an amendment that would prohibit Congress from passing such a fee.
“The **climate** has been changing from the dawn of time,” Cruz said in a debate. “The **climate** will **change** as long as we have a planet Earth.”
His challenger, Democrat Beto O’Rourke, has an overall score of 96.25. What kept him short of acing the ranking is that the guide “could not find statements by the Congressman publicly advocating for a fee on carbon.”
“We all know that there are differences between Republicans and Democrats on the issue, but to me what was stunning was the extent of the divide between the parties,” Strickler said. “What this demonstrates is that **climate** politics are overwhelmingly driven by party.”
Does that mean Republicans should get graded on a curve? Should a Republican that doesn’t call **climate** **change** a hoax get a boost given where the rest of the party stands? “That might be fair if we weren’t in an urgent temperature rise scenario,” Strickler said. “I would never give them the benefit of a higher score just because [the rest of the party] are so backward.”
**Climate** **change** is starting to emerge as a campaign issue
Now, we know few voters pick candidates based on environmental positions alone. “I would not suggest that it’s the top-tier issue,” said Pete Maysmith, senior vice president for campaigns at the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund.
The League of Conservation Voters has its own scorecard, but it focuses only on officials in office and covers environmental issues writ large rather than **climate** **change** in particular. The Sierra Club has a similar guide.
But as the world warms, its consequences are hitting closer and closer to home. Droughts, storms, declining rivers and snowpack, and intense heat — events that were worsened by **climate** **change** — have cost billions of dollars in damages and taken thousands of lives across the United States over the past year.
So it makes sense that some running for office have used **climate** **change** as a way to distinguish themselves. “I think what matters to voters is that the issue connects in some way to their life,” said Maysmith.
It was refreshing to see CNN’s Jake Tapper open the Florida gubernatorial debate between Republican Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum earlier this month with a question about **climate** policies. Floridians had recently been battered by Hurricane Michael, a storm that strengthened startlingly fast in part due to warming water. Many of Florida’s beaches were littered with dead animals this year after a toxic red tide, a phenomenon also worsened by **climate** **change**.
“There is a scientific consensus that warmer waters from **climate** **change** are making hurricanes stronger as well as a stark warning that the world just received from the United Nations on **climate** **change**,” Tapper said.
The New Jersey Star-Ledger, in its hilariously tepid endorsement of Democrat Robert Menendez for Senate, cited his efforts on **climate** **change** as a bright spot on his record.
Candidates in midterm election races in states like New Mexico, Illinois, and Nevada have brought up **climate** **change** on their own as well, promoting their own policies to cut greenhouse gases and promote clean energy. The IPCC report also came up in other congressional debates.
Meanwhile, as Vox’s David Roberts noted, pro-fossil fuel campaigners have opened a firehose of money, spending upward of $50 million to defeat two state-level **climate** initiatives this election cycle alone."
2018-05-23 09:10:02,vox.com,11.424655,Lean Left,The Second Amendment allows for more gun control than you think,"Ten years ago, when a divided Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller that the **Second** **Amendment** includes a right to individual possession of firearms, dissenting Justice John Paul Stevens lamented that it was “a law-changing decision” that would cause “a major upheaval.”
Heller is a landmark case in many ways, not least of which for Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion, one of his most discussed and most quoted. But a close look at decisions over the past decade indicates that the case has not revolutionized judicial treatment of gun laws in quite the way that Stevens and others might have feared or gun rights supporters might have hoped.
Some gun rights advocates have suggested that’s because lower courts have been thumbing their nose at Scalia’s opinion in an act of massive resistance akin to the South’s refusal to desegregate after Brown v. Board of Education.
But Scalia’s opinion made clear that the decision would leave untouched many “longstanding prohibitions” on the use of guns. In practice, courts have concluded that these prohibitions and others like them pass constitutional muster. Our research confirms, as other research has suggested, that most **Second** **Amendment** claims fail. We also find that most fail precisely because of limitations that Heller itself places on the right to bear arms.
This finding has new relevance as Americans debate yet another school shooting, this time in Santa Fe, Texas. Many politicians, advocates, and commentators have suggested that the **Second** **Amendment** prohibits further gun regulation. But hundreds of judicial decisions from across the country indicate otherwise.
The **Second** **Amendment**, as courts have come to interpret it, undoubtedly protects a fundamental constitutional right, but it also leaves room for a potentially wide range of regulation.
The decision remains a big deal, but it didn’t overturn the entire gun-control regime
Justice Stevens was right to call Heller a “law-changing decision,” and it has undoubtedly had an impact on some types of gun regulation, for example by limiting some highly restrictive public carry regulations, including public carry bans. The Court’s decision might also have had a deterrent effect on gun regulation, as it gives a powerful rhetorical tool to those seeking to prevent or roll back gun laws through the political process.
But as a matter of law, gun jurisprudence has not been turned upside down, as Justice Stevens feared. Rather, courts are finding ways to accommodate both the new individual right as well as compelling interests like public safety.
It’s not the world that gun control advocates would wish for. But it looks a lot like “normal” constitutional law. In the decade since Heller, the justices have declined dozens of opportunities to expound on the right to keep and bear arms, choosing not to grant certiorari (that is, agree to hear cases), with only two exceptions.
In 2010’s McDonald v. City of Chicago, the Court made the **Second** **Amendment** applicable to state and local regulations — a significant decision in practical terms, since state and local laws constitute the bulk of firearms regulation. And in a short, unsigned 2016 opinion, the Court vacated the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court’s upholding of a stun gun ban.
The Court’s unwillingness to hear another gun rights case recently led a frustrated Justice Thomas, who voted with the majority in Heller, to call the **Second** **Amendment** a “constitutional orphan.”
But that’s a misreading of the evidence. the Supreme Court does not have sole responsibility for the development of constitutional doctrine. Vastly more constitutional questions are resolved in lower courts, including the federal courts of appeals, than in the Supreme Court. And when those courts reach agreement on legal issues, the justices are generally less inclined to intervene.
Those lower courts have resolved more than 1,000 **Second** **Amendment** challenges in the past 10 years. This makes it possible, even as the Supreme Court stays above the fray, to say something about the law governing the right to keep and bear arms.
In our new study, we coded every available **Second** **Amendment** decision (state and federal, trial and appellate) from Heller through February 1, 2016. For each individual **Second** **Amendment** challenge, we asked roughly 100 questions about the content of the challenge, the result, and the court’s methodology. We assembled more than 100,000 data points, allowing us to paint a picture of where **Second** **Amendment** law stands today.
Most **Second** **Amendment** claims fail
Any time a litigant raises a **Second** **Amendment** claim, he or she is arguing that a particular government action, typically a gun regulation, is unconstitutional. It is by now well-recognized that the vast majority of these claims have failed, and our data confirms it. Gun rights and gun regulation groups both regularly note this fact — though they draw very different conclusions.
For advocates of strong gun rights, the low success rate is fodder for the view that courts are hostile to the **Second** **Amendment**. Scholars, too, sometimes suggest that lower courts are flouting Scalia’s opinion or narrowing it from below.
Our data suggests alternative explanations, beginning with the objective weakness of many **Second** **Amendment** claims.
Most **Second** **Amendment** claims fail because of Heller itself
The merit, or lack thereof, of a **Second** **Amendment** challenge obviously correlates with success or failure. Strong claims should succeed at a higher rate than weak ones.
That may sound tautological, but a closer look at the data suggests that lower courts are using Heller to judge which claims are strong and which are weak. To be sure, “strength” and “weakness” will often be a matter of opinion, but the language of Heller makes it clear that some kinds of claims are flawed from the outset. Indeed, 60 percent of the judicial decisions in our data set quote, at least in part, the passage in Scalia’s opinion in which he explains that the **Second** **Amendment**, “[l]ike most rights, … is not unlimited.” Scalia went on to write:
Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the **Second** **Amendment**, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.
This language from Heller gives constitutional blessing to a potentially wide range of regulation. So it should be unsurprising that the vast majority of the cases citing it go on to reject the **Second** **Amendment** claim and uphold the challenged law. Even when courts do not explicitly cite this particular passage in upholding gun laws, they often rely on other precedents that do so. That explains why the percentage of cases citing it has been steadily declining, as courts start to cite their own prior decisions that incorporate Heller’s list of exceptions.
The frequency of citations to the “longstanding prohibitions” passage helps explain why the success rate for **Second** **Amendment** claims is so low. For example, 24 percent of the challenges in our set are to felon-in-possession laws, which Scalia specifically singled out as appropriate; of those, 99 percent are losers.
What’s more, nearly three-quarters of the challenges in our data set — 742 of 1,153 — involve criminal cases, where the success rate of constitutional claims can be expected to be lower. Unlike civil litigants, who may have a choice of whether to be in court at all, and who are more likely to be paying their own lawyers, criminal defendants facing serious charges have every incentive to make whatever arguments they can get away with.
That kind of kitchen sink approach, combined with the fact that many criminal laws involving guns fall within the categories Scalia identified, lead to a low rate of success of **Second** **Amendment** claims in criminal cases: 6 percent overall.
**Second** **Amendment** doctrine incorporates tools commonly used throughout constitutional law
Our data shows that courts deciding **Second** **Amendment** challenges are drawing on tools common to other areas of constitutional law. This suggests that courts are normalizing the post-Heller **Second** **Amendment** and treating it like other constitutional rights: It’s subject to exceptions, some of which are derived from history, and to regulations that further certain important government interests. Courts continue to give considerable weight to the undeniable public safety concerns that animate most gun regulation.
In the immediate aftermath of Heller, it was not clear what form of doctrine would apply to the **Second** **Amendment**. But the 1,000 cases since Heller show courts using the basic tools of analysis familiar to constitutional lawyers.
Borrowing in part from First **Amendment** doctrine, for example, almost every federal court of appeal has adopted a two-part test that first asks whether the relevant person, weapon, or activity falls within the scope of the **Second** **Amendment**. As noted above, hundreds of **Second** **Amendment** cases — those involving felons or people with mental illness, for example — lose at this step.
Concealed carry, too, has been excluded from constitutional coverage, in keeping with Scalia’s observation in Heller that “the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the **Second** **Amendment** or state analogues.”
If the case makes it past step one, the courts go on to ask whether the challenged law is constitutional in light of both the burden it imposes on the right to keep and bear arms and the public interest it furthers.
Even at this point, plaintiffs asserting a right to bear arms face a high hurdle because the public interest in these cases is almost always public safety: Weapons, and especially lethal weapons, pose an obvious risk if misused.
That’s not to say that every law will be properly tailored to further that public interest, and the laws that have been struck down have tended to be those that are overbroad or otherwise go “too far.” In Moore v. Madigan, for example, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit struck down Illinois’s statewide ban on public carry.
But just as in other areas of law, judges in **Second** **Amendment** cases tend to give some deference to the policy choices and expertise of elected officials.
As a matter of methodology, then, the **Second** **Amendment** looks increasingly like “normal” constitutional law, which in turn can explain one reason so many challenges to weapons laws fail.
In much of the country, there are very few gun laws to challenge. That’s a political as much as a constitutional issue.
We have argued elsewhere, including at Vox, that discussions about the scope and strength of the **Second** **Amendment** should take account of local and regional variation when it comes to gun rights and regulation.
In keeping with those arguments, our data set shows that in the decade since Heller, **Second** **Amendment** challenges (and successes) are not evenly distributed throughout the country. Two courts, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits, account for about one-third of the challenges in the federal courts of appeal. Four states account for 68 percent of the state appellate challenges.
Gun rights advocates have had more success in those courts, both in absolute terms and proportionally. The most obvious cause of this regional variation is that the circuits and states with the most **Second** **Amendment** litigation, and the most **Second** **Amendment** successes, are those that already have comparatively stringent gun control. Federal laws apply nationally and impose some important restrictions (including the felon ban discussed above), but in many parts of the United States, there simply aren’t many gun laws to challenge.
That again helps explain the low success rate of **Second** **Amendment** litigation; there simply isn’t a lot of low-hanging fruit for gun rights litigators. The **Second** **Amendment** doesn’t have much work to do, it appears, because gun politics prevent most stringent regulations from being enacted in the first place. When DC’s and Chicago’s handgun bans were struck down in Heller and McDonald, for example, they were the only two such laws on the books in major American cities.
That suggests that gun laws in the US face political hurdles as much as they do constitutional hurdles.
**Second** **Amendment** litigation shows no signs of slowing down
Despite the overall failure rate, litigation rates have not decreased in the 10 years since Heller. That’s surprising in many ways. Since Heller represented a sea change in the law, one might expect an initial spike in litigation, as gun owners rushed to test the constitutionality of existing laws and the breadth of the Court’s holding. (The lawsuit that led to McDonald was filed the day Heller was decided.)
That surge would establish the new contours of the law, after which lawsuits would decrease as regulators and litigants came to accept the new status quo. Similarly, one might expect a high rate of initial success in those challenges, as gun laws across the country first became subject to the “individual right” reading of the **Second** **Amendment**, followed by a tapering off of success as those laws were struck down.
However, litigation rates remained consistent and high, and the rate of success increased during the period of our study. Our data alone cannot explain these counterintuitive trends, but it is possible that some litigants have failed to internalize consensus about what makes for a successful challenge, while others have adapted to bring better cases.
Others, perhaps, are content to fling themselves against Heller’s limitations and to hold up their failures as evidence that they must try harder — winning politically by losing in court.
The **Second** **Amendment** remains fertile territory for constitutional litigation and scholarship. The **Second** **Amendment** still faces foundational uncertainties with regard to a wide range of doctrinal and theoretical questions — far more so than the First **Amendment**, which has generated a century’s worth of case law and scholarship. For lawyers and scholars interested in the **Second** **Amendment**, this is an exciting time.
But the **Second** **Amendment** is no longer “terra incognita,” as one federal judge put it after Heller. Our data helps to map the post-Heller territory, and our hope is that it might help bring some much-needed clarity not only to the law but to the broader gun debate.

2019-08-18 09:12:17,thedailybeast.com,11.3115,Center,How Slave Owners Dictated the Language of the 2nd Amendment,"Mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, have highlighted once again the importance of the Supreme Court’s 2008 landmark decision District of Columbia v. Heller declaring that the **Second** **Amendment** protects an individual’s right to possess a gun.
Writing for the Court’s conservative majority, Justice Antonin Scalia held that a Washington, D.C., gun law banning handguns and requiring that even lawful guns in a home be kept nonfunctional violated the **Second** **Amendment**.
That part of Scalia’s decision is clear, but what his decision fails to acknowledge, as criticism of it has pointed out, is how the **Second** **Amendment** in providing for slave control played a crucial role in the willingness of the influential state of Virginia to ratify the Constitution.
On its surface the **Second** **Amendment** seems straightforward. In 27 words it declares, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” But interpretative problems arise when we try to figure out the relationship the two parts of the **Second** **Amendment** have with each other.
In his ruling Scalia made a point of dividing the **amendment** into separate halves. He contended that while the militia or “prefatory” clause introduced the **Second** **Amendment**, it did not curtail the **second** or “operative” clause’s assertion of the right to bear arms. “The former does not limit the latter grammatically, but rather announces a purpose,” Scalia observed on his way to concluding, “Putting all of these textual elements together, we find that they guarantee the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.”
By contrast, James Madison, the author of the **Second** **Amendment**, wrote his **amendment** with his eye firmly fixed on practical politics. He introduced the **amendment** during Virginia’s debate over the ratification of the Constitution because Virginia Governor Patrick Henry saw danger lurking in Article 1, Section 8, of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to provide for “organizing, arming, and disciplining” militias.
Henry feared that without checks upon it, Congress could undermine the ability of militias in Virginia and elsewhere in the South to suppress slave uprisings and pursue runaway slaves.
The militia issue was important enough for Henry to see it as grounds for opposing ratification of the Constitution. The positive power Congress had over militias, Henry reasoned, could easily be turned into restrictive power. “By this sir, you see that their control over our best defence is unlimited,” Henry warned his fellow Virginians.
“ Only the white men in the Virginia militia had the right to bear arms. ”
It took Madison two drafts to get the **Second** **Amendment** into the single sentence it is today. His careful wording was deliberate. In drawing a connection between militias and the right to bear arms rather than simply defending the right to bear arms, Madison, a slave holder himself, was speaking to his state’s ruling powers. Only the white men in the Virginia militia had the right to bear arms. Free African-Americans could join the militia, but they were limited to being drummers or buglers.
The case for seeing the **Second** **Amendment** as part of the early debate over slave control and militias has been made with great persuasiveness by former Pennsylvania Assistant Attorney General Anthony F. Picadio in both the 2019 Pennsylvania Bar Quarterly and Transpartisan Review and by law professor Carl T. Bogus in the University of California, Davis Law Review of 1998.
And in addition to such books as Professor Sally Hadden’s 2003 study, Slave Patrols: Law and Violence in Virginia and the Carolinas, and Brennan Center for Justice President Michael Waldman’s 2014 history, The **Second** **Amendment**: A Biography, there are also strong op-eds on this subject.
But the link between slave control and the **Second** **Amendment** has not become a feature of today’s debate over gun control. That is good news for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump.
They should not, though, breathe easy. In the end, Justice Scalia never saw his majority opinion in the District of Columbia v. Heller eliminating the government’s ability to regulate guns. “Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the **Second** **Amendment**,” Scalia cautioned, “nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools or government buildings or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.”"
2016-05-09 11:58:46,thefederalist.com,11.300778,Lean Right,Trump Is Right: Hillary Clinton Wants To Take Your Guns,"Speaking at a rally in Washington state on Saturday, Donald Trump announced: “Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the **Second** **Amendment**.” He was correct: she does, unequivocally and by her own admission.
It is a bit of a miracle when Trump gets something right, but give him at least this much credit: he is willing to take Mrs. Clinton at her word.
The media refused to believe him. CNN stated Trump’s claims were “wild” and that Clinton “has never argued for abolishing the **Second** **Amendment**.” Ben Jacobs at The Guardian wrote that Clinton “has never made any statement in support of abolishing the **second** **amendment** [sic] or confiscating the personal firearms of citizens.” Evelyn Rupert at The Hill recalled that Clinton had recently declared “we can’t ignore the **Second** **Amendment**,” as if that statement actually, you know, means anything.
It is difficult to believe anything Hillary Clinton says—she would almost certainly lie about even the weather outside her window if it would get her a few more electoral votes in Utah—but we can at least assume she means what she says about constitutional gun rights, her views on which she aired at a private fundraiser last fall: “The Supreme Court is wrong on the **Second** **Amendment**,” she said, a proclamation that can only be a reference to the court’s 2008 decision in D.C. v. Heller, which affirmed that the **Second** **Amendment** protects an individual right to firearms.
To disagree with the Supreme Court over Heller is to disagree with the right of individual Americans to own firearms. It is to call for abolishing the **Second** **Amendment**. There is simply no other way to interpret Clinton’s words, or her intentions.
There is, to be fair, no guarantee that Trump does not also want to take your guns away. He, like Hillary Clinton, is a serial liar, a profoundly dishonest politician and someone with a barely disguised disdain for the unique civic values that set America apart from the rest of the world—one of which is widespread civilian firearm ownership. In all probability, Trump would probably repeal the **Second** **Amendment**, too, if he sensed this would afford him even a minor political advantage.
But that does not change the facts of the matter: Hillary Clinton does want to abolish the **Second** **Amendment**. She does want to take your guns away. This is a fact."
2015-10-15 12:30:02,vox.com,11.255869,Lean Left,"This video has a chilling start, but it makes a great point about the 2nd Amendment","The **Second** **Amendment** is more than 220 years old. When it was written, the world did not have machine guns, assault rifles, or tanks, instead relying on clunky muskets that were a pain to reload.
Yet as a video from States United to Prevent Gun Violence points out, America's lax gun laws are often based on a reading of the **Second** **Amendment** that makes it hard to pass restrictive gun laws, even as our weapons get much, much deadlier.
Warning: Graphic content:
Although it doesn't state this explicitly, the video also exposes one of the more absurd arguments in favor of the **Second** **Amendment**: Many Americans believe the right to bear arms offers protection from a potentially tyrannical government. But while granting private citizens the right to own guns in 1791 may have created some symmetry between the government and the people — both would fight with horses and muskets — that's not true anymore. Guns owned by civilians have gotten more powerful, and weapons the government uses have gotten even more powerful. So the guns interpreted to be legal under the **Second** **Amendment** would fall far, far short of the incredible arsenal the US military uses today.
Still, many legal scholars argue that the **Second** **Amendment** has been misinterpreted in recent decades. According to this view, the **Second** **Amendment** wasn't about letting individuals bear arms, but about individuals in state militias — so it was supposed to secure the ability of states, not private citizens, to arm themselves.
Former US Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens captured this argument in the Washington Post:
The first 10 amendments to the Constitution placed limits on the powers of the new federal government. Concern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states led to the adoption of the **Second** **Amendment**, which provides that ""a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" For more than 200 years following the adoption of that **amendment**, federal judges uniformly understood that the right protected by that text was limited in two ways: First, it applied only to keeping and bearing arms for military purposes, and **second**, while it limited the power of the federal government, it did not impose any limit whatsoever on the power of states or local governments to regulate the ownership or use of firearms. Thus, in United States v. Miller, decided in 1939, the court unanimously held that Congress could prohibit the possession of a sawed-off shotgun because that sort of weapon had no reasonable relation to the preservation or efficiency of a ""well regulated Militia."" When I joined the court in 1975, that holding was generally understood as limiting the scope of the **Second** **Amendment** to uses of arms that were related to military activities. During the years when Warren Burger was chief justice, from 1969 to 1986, no judge or justice expressed any doubt about the limited coverage of the **amendment**, and I cannot recall any judge suggesting that the **amendment** might place any limit on state authority to do anything.
Organizations like the National Rifle Association disagreed with this position, mounting vigorous campaigns to change public and scholarly interpretations of the **Second** **Amendment**. It worked, culminating in Supreme Court decisions in 2008 and 2010 that for the very first time acknowledged an individual's rights to bear arms for self-defense.
The recency of these rulings may be surprising to many Americans, who think the **Second** Amendment's individual protections have been accepted as fact for much longer than the 2008 and 2010 decisions suggest. But it took more than 200 years for the Supreme Court to explicitly acknowledge the individual rights, changing just how far governments can go when restricting access to guns.

2018-03-27 11:40:02,vox.com,11.203859,Lean Left,Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens: repeal the 2nd Amendment,"Former US Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens says that March for Our Lives organizers should add a new proposal to their list of demands: repealing the **Second** **Amendment**.
In a New York Times op-ed, Stevens argued that for most of US history, the **Second** **Amendment** was interpreted narrowly — not placing a strict limit on federal or state governments’ ability to regulate firearms. But that changed recently, when the Supreme Court ruled that the **Second** **Amendment** protects an individual right to bear arms, Stevens wrote:
In 2008, the Supreme Court overturned Chief Justice Burger’s and others’ long-settled understanding of the **Second** Amendment’s limited reach by ruling, in District of Columbia v. Heller, that there was an individual right to bear arms. I was among the four dissenters. That decision — which I remain convinced was wrong and certainly was debatable — has provided the N.R.A. with a propaganda weapon of immense power. Overturning that decision via a constitutional **amendment** to get rid of the **Second** **Amendment** would be simple and would do more to weaken the N.R.A.’s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.
Although Stevens views this as a misinterpretation of the **Second** **Amendment**, the reality is it’s now enshrined into constitutional law. So reformers should take drastic action, Stevens wrote, to “eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States — unlike every other market in the world. It would make our schoolchildren safer than they have been since 2008 and honor the memories of the many, indeed far too many, victims of recent gun violence.”
The problem with Stevens’s proposal is that the barrier to passing new gun control laws isn’t legal but political. Lawmakers aren’t as worried about their proposals getting struck down by a court as they are about the political backlash to new gun laws. And if Congress and states can’t even pass milder gun control measures, they’re not going to strike down a constitutional **amendment**.
The **Second** **Amendment** really has been reintrepreted
Stevens’s history isn’t wrong here — the **Second** **Amendment** really has been reinterpreted over time.
For much of US history, the **Second** **Amendment** was seen as defending collective — not individual — rights. This protected the right to bear arms only within the context of a militia. It’s only more recently that the **Second** **Amendment** has been expanded to protect an individual right to bear arms, making it much more difficult to regulate guns.
The collective approach, Fordham University historian Saul Cornell previously told me, came out of a Cincinnatus view toward guns and defense — a reference to the legendary Roman general who, according to the story (and possibly myth), went back to farming instead of attempting to seize more power after he led the Romans to victories.
This kind of republican value was embedded in American values at the time, so the founders made sure to enshrine it in the Constitution. But it only preserved the collective right to own firearms insofar as able-bodied men needed the weapons to help defend their state and country.
Courts and legal scholars widely accepted this for decades.
Consider previous Supreme Court decisions: In 1939, the Court unanimously ruled in United States v. Miller that Congress can ban sawed-off shotguns because that weapon was of no use in a well-regulated militia, making it clear that the right to bear arms was inseparable from the role of a militia.
Justice James McReynolds wrote in the majority opinion, “The Court cannot take judicial notice that a shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches long has today any reasonable relation to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia, and therefore cannot say that the **Second** **Amendment** guarantees to the citizen the right to keep and bear such a weapon.”
That only changed in 2008’s District of Columbia v. Heller, when the Court concluded that “the **Second** **Amendment** conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms.”
This was in part a result of decades of campaigning by gun rights activists, particularly the National Rifle Association (NRA), to change how the public views the **Second** **Amendment**.
As Carl T. Bogus, a researcher at the Roger Williams University School of Law, noted in a 2000 law review article, before 1970, “a total of three [law review journal] articles endorsed the individual right model and twenty-two subscribed to the collective right view.” He added, “From 1970 to 1989, twenty-five articles adhering to the collective right view were published (nothing unusual there), but so were twenty-seven articles endorsing the individual right model.”
At least 16 of the individual rights model articles “were written by lawyers who had been directly employed by or represented the NRA or other gun rights organizations, although they did not always so identify themselves in the author’s footnote.”
By the 1990s, the tide had changed: “At least fifty-eight law review articles endorsing the individual right view would be published during the 1990s (compared to twenty-nine favoring the collective right position).”
It can be easy to underestimate the impact of these kinds of journal articles. Many people may wonder who even reads law review journals. The answer, however, is legal scholars, lawyers, judges, and politicians — and these people then permeate their ideas in popular media and in their day-to-day work. Over time, that can lead to a big shift in public opinion and policy.
The Supreme Court’s new reading of the **Second** **Amendment** reflects that. And from Stevens’s view, it has created such an untenable position that he argues the **amendment** must now be repealed.
This idea isn’t going to get anywhere
While Stevens’s historical retelling may be correct, the reality is this proposal isn’t going to get very far.
Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and author of Gunfight, argued on Twitter that the basic problem here is this is now more a political battle than a legal one: Even before the Supreme Court’s Heller decision, gun control struggled — because organizations like the NRA made it very difficult, politically, to get anything done. That’s the real hurdle, Winkler claimed, more than how the courts interpret the **Second** **Amendment**.
Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens pens an op-ed calling for repeal of the **Second** **Amendment**. He’s wrong - even (especially) if you agree with Stevens’s goal of better gun control. (Thread) https://t.co/oPBpFF8ron — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
The **Second** **Amendment** is not the barrier to gun reform that Stevens imagines. Recall that America’s gun problem and inability to enact meaningful reform predates Supreme Court’s 2008 decision. That ruling did not have a major effect on the gun debate. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
About the only things Heller did was (1) breed tremendous amounts of litigation - mostly won by supporters of gun control; (2) give @NRA affirmation of their reading of the Constitution. But the @NRA was a huge political powerhouse before. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
Repealing the **Second** **Amendment** would do little to change America’s gun laws. Georgia, Texas, and the appx 38 other states that are solidly anti-gun control aren’t going to repeal their laws allowing concealed carry. Nor are they going to ban AR-15s. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
Repealing the **Second** **Amendment** would also have little to no effect on the remaining 10 that lean stronger in favor of gun regulation. Few laws have been overturned and they have not generally found the 2A to be a barrier in court. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
Congress could conceivably force restrictive gun laws on the gun-friendly states. But that would require overcoming a filibuster in the Senate, which in the issue of guns seems extremely unlikely. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
So if we repealed the **Second** **Amendment** we would be pretty much where we were before 2008’s Heller opinion. Do you think our gun laws were so much better then? — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
The Secind **Amendment** is not a barrier to enacting good gun laws. The @NRA is. It’s the politics of guns that controls our gun laws, not the law of the **Second** **Amendment**. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
Of course all this overlooks the obvious problem: There’s not a snowflakes chance in hell we are going to repeal the **Second** **Amendment** anytime soon. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
We can’t even get Congress to pass a law banning bump stocks. We can’t get Congress to mandate universal background checks. And Stevens thinks 2/3s of Congress will vote to repeal the 2A? And 3/4 of the states will ratify such an **amendment**? Nonsense. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
Stevens’s call to repeal the 2A is not only ineffective but worse: it makes it even harder to pass good gun laws today. It plays right into the hands of the @nra which can now point to this op-ed and say, “See, we told you they want to take away your rights and your guns.” — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
The @NRA says that anyway of course but Stevens gives them evidence to vote when critics object. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
If the fate of the **Second** **Amendment** is at issue, rather than the fate of the gun age or background checks, then gun control advocates are playing on the wrong field - one on which they are sure to lose. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
Let’s just hope that Stevens’s op-ed will not inspire many to fight for repeal of the **Second** **Amendment**. (End) — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
For gun control advocates, the good news is this may be changing.
The political obstacle has not been public opinion per se. Based on surveys by Gallup and the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans back stricter gun laws, and even bigger majorities support specific policies like universal background checks, restrictions on people with mental illness buying guns, an assault weapons ban, and a federal database to track gun sales, with support for these policies sometimes topping 75 percent even among Republicans. This has been true for years in US politics.
Instead, the big obstacle is issue intensity. Republican strategist Grover Norquist put it this way, back in 2000: “The question is intensity versus preference. You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls. But are they going to vote on their ‘control’ position?” Probably not, he suggested, “but for that 4-5 percent who care about guns, they will vote on this.”
The March for Our Lives may be changing this. By getting people riled up on the issue of guns — to the point that hundreds of thousands came to Washington, DC, to march over the weekend — the movement can build a voting group that’s just as passionate on gun control as the other side is for gun rights.
Winkler suggested that this is the right path forward:
I agree! We are seeing a real transformation of the gun control advocacy movement. It’s finally starting to look like a movement. Instead of repealing the 2A, gun control proponents need to mobilize politically. That seems to be happening now. https://t.co/IS1cYJuWwT — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
None of that means that calling for the end of the **Second** **Amendment** is pointless. It could help shift the Overton window on guns, broadening what’s acceptable in public discourse. After all, the NRA has long worked against policies, like universal background checks, that are enormously popular with the American people. Perhaps an equal counterweight on the other side could, overall, push the US closer to the middle ground that most Americans support.
But an actual repeal almost certainly won’t happen anytime soon — and even without a **Second** **Amendment**, there are still some serious political forces for gun control advocates to overcome."
2016-03-03 22:51:57,vox.com,11.198379,Lean Left,Marco Rubio is wrong: The 2nd Amendment isn't 2nd because it's the 2nd most important,"At Thursday's Republican debate, Marco Rubio suggested that the **Second** **Amendment** is **second** because the founders saw it as the **second** most important right in the Bill of Rights. ""It's the constitutional right of every American to protect themselves and their families,"" Rubio said. ""It is the **Second** **Amendment** for a reason.""
This is wrong. The amendments are actually in the order they're in to align with the articles of the Constitution.
Brian Palmer explained for Slate:
The original first **amendment**, which did not pass, outlined how the number of seats in Congress would rise in response to population growth—a modification of Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution. The original **second** **amendment**, which initially fell short of ratification and later became the 27th **Amendment**, banned members of Congress from raising their own salaries before voters had an opportunity to oust them. That related to Article I, Section 6, which deals with congressional compensation. The now-sacred First **Amendment** was originally slated to sit in the far less distinguished third position. That doesn't mean the founding fathers thought congressional salary more important than the freedom of speech. Rather, the First **Amendment** relates to the powers of the legislature, which come later in the Constitution than does the structure of Congress. According to Yale professor Akhil Reed Amar, the provision we now know as the First **Amendment** begins with the phrase ""Congress shall make no law"" because it contrasts with Article I, Section 8, which begins ""Congress shall have power."" The **Second**, Third, and Fourth Amendments limit what Congress may do, extending the list of proscriptions found in Constitution's next provision, Article I, Section 9. Amendments five through eight, dealing with such issues as juries, bail, and cruel and unusual punishment, limit the government's judicial powers. They relate to Article 3 of the Constitution, which establishes the court system. The final two amendments from the Bill of Rights are guides to interpreting the Constitution as a whole, and likely would have been added to the end.
So there you have it. The **Second** Amendment's placement has nothing to do with the founders' views of its importance.
Watch: America's gun problem, explained"
2013-08-22 08:45:00,thedailybeast.com,11.18679,Center,Justice Scalia Goes Gun Crazy,"America has more than its fair share of extremists who believe people need to stock up on guns to fight against tyrannical government in Washington.Add one more to the list: Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. In a speech in Montana on Monday, the jurist was asked about the **Second** **Amendment** and what arms were protected by that provision of the Constitution. That “remains to be determined,” he replied. As one example, he asked if people have a right to “bear shoulder-fired rocket launchers?” Perhaps they do, Scalia suggested. The answer would turn on the historical understanding of the Framers, who Scalia said included the **Second** **Amendment** in part to preserve the right of people to revolt against a tyrannical leader.
Five years ago, in a case called District of Columbia v. Heller, Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, said that the core of the **Second** **Amendment** was personal self-defense. The arms protected, he wrote, were those that are in common use for lawful purposes, like handguns. Perhaps four-and-a-half years of living under President Barak Obama—you know, that socialist from Africa who’s bent on destroying America—has convinced Scalia that Americans need a right to far more powerful weapons. If the **Second** **Amendment** guarantees a right to revolt against the government, then surely Scalia’s question about shoulder-fired rocket launchers isn’t so hypothetical. Americans would need such rocket-launchers—along with fully-automatic machine guns—to have any reasonable chance of success against the military’s weapons. Handguns aren’t going to cut it against Obama’s drones, stealth fighters, and other high-tech, high-powered weapons.
The idea that the **Second** **Amendment** gives people the right to revolt against government is broadly shared among gun-rights extremists. And, indeed, the Framers were armed revolutionaries who understood that guns were useful for throwing off the yoke of tyranny. No doubt they believed that an armed citizenry would make it difficult for a tyrannical ruler to run roughshod over the people. But that’s not why they put the **Second** **Amendment** in the Constitution.
The Constitution was intended to be a charter of government, not a recipe for revolution. It was, as the legendary Chief Justice John Marshall said of the Constitution in 1819, “intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.” The Framers thought the Constitution itself, with its division of powers, reliance on popular sovereignty, and judicial oversight, would prevent tyranny from ever arising. The Framers had the humility to recognize that this charter of government may prove flawed. Yet the mechanism for changing it was the **amendment** procedures of Article V, not a revolution through the **Second** **Amendment**.
The insurrectionist understanding of the **Second** **Amendment** fails to account for two other features of the Constitution. First, the **Second** **Amendment** itself includes a preamble referring to the necessity of a “well-regulated militia.” Contrary to the views of some gun-control advocates, the militia referred to was not the National Guard. As Scalia correctly explained in the Heller case, the framers thought we, the common people, were all part of the citizens militia. Nonetheless, as part of that militia we must be “well regulated.” While there are genuine debates about what types of regulations are permissible under the **Second** **Amendment**, there is no doubt that the Framers thought that those regulations of the militia would come from the government. So how can the **Second** **Amendment** be read to provide a right to revolt against the government?
If there was any doubt about the government’s power to regulate gun owners—that is, the militia—that should be put to rest by Article I, Section 8. That part of the Constitution gives Congress the authority “for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia.” A militia rising up against Washington, however, is hardly one that is disciplined. Moreover, that same section of the Constitution explicitly provides that Congress shall have the power of “calling forth the militia to … suppress insurrections.”
In other words, the Framers believed the militia would put down revolutions, not engage in them. Unfortunately, Justice Scalia, that acclaimed lover of originalism, seems to be taking his cues from the Tea Party rather than from the text and history of the Constitution."
2019-08-24 09:21:43,thedailybeast.com,11.125174,Center,The Second Amendment Ate the Constitution,"The **Second** **Amendment** has failed us.
Time after time, in the wake of a tragedy, we are told that we cannot ban the weapons used in these attacks because the **Second** **Amendment** is necessary to keep a tyrannical government at bay. We can’t limit it, the argument goes, because it’s the only thing protecting all the other ones. In the face of our constitutional rights, any pragmatic concerns regarding losses of life are irrelevant.
If only such logic applied elsewhere. Of the first eight amendments to the Constitution, there are three untouched by the War on Terror—the Seventh **Amendment**, which only applies to civil trials, the Third **Amendment**, against forcing civilians to house soldiers, and the **Second** **Amendment**.
We’ve allowed mass surveillance on the phone calls and emails of U.S. citizens without probable cause or a (traditionally constitutionally required) warrant. We’ve allowed the monitoring of emails of professors, attorneys, and even a former Republican candidate for legislative office. We have placed U.S. citizens on watchlists, encouraging law enforcement to compile and share data on people, including biometric data, even those with no named connection to a foreign terrorist organization, implicating a huge change in Fourth **Amendment** protections. We have sent FBI agents into houses of worship to gather information on U.S. citizens, undermining the faith citizens have in their community, and their ability to discuss political and religious issues in those communities. The FBI has also infiltrated protests and civil rights activists, clearly reaching into traditional First **Amendment** territory.
And it doesn’t end there. We’ve allowed more and more classified information into our court cases, undermining the ability of lawyers to investigate and present a defense to charges. This fundamentally alters our adversarial system and our understanding of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments on which it is based. We’ve placed more and more U.S. citizens in solitary confinement, even prior to trial, based on the notion that it is simply too dangerous to allow them to communicate with the outside world. This implicates not only the Sixth **Amendment** but the Eighth **Amendment** as well.
How is it that the **Second** **Amendment** is the only relevant **amendment** that we cannot bear to impose upon at all? If the logic is that the **Second** **Amendment** protects all the others, it has failed.
Worse yet, our extreme protection of the **Second** **Amendment** adds to the stated need to infringe on all the other amendments. In the wake of two mass shootings in 24 hours, law enforcement experts have demanded that we give law enforcement the same powers in domestic cases that they have in international investigations. But the invasions allowed in the international realm were meant to be an exception, not the rule, because in order to maintain our control of government we need to be able to criticize it and explore political complaints without fearing arrest from our statements. Treating domestic anti-government rhetoric the way we treat international anti-government rhetoric would destroy the traditional limits on government interference in political speech.
Once, banning pure speech without evidence of imminent danger from that speech was unthinkable. Now, with guns so readily available, all threats become imminent. And still **Second** **Amendment** proponents insist that it is sacrosanct, but that the government should monitor speech and association more heavily instead. Apparently, not only our children, but all our other rights and liberties must be sacrificed at the altar of the right to bear arms.
Can its existence justify the loss of all the others? Would assault rifles enable fighting off the U.S. government, while weapons of mass destruction (such as improvised explosive devices) and surface-to-air missiles are banned? Even with weapons of mass destruction, how far could political opposition get when all our conversations are monitored, political advocates are afraid to talk to each other, and members of unpopular groups are afraid the government might find any excuse to arrest and prosecute them? Just what type of American liberty are gun-rights advocates hoping to protect?
There is a cannibal hiding in our Bill of Rights, devouring the fundamental freedoms of our society. We are down to three choices—chain our demon, devolve into a Orwellian tyranny of omnipresent surveillance, or continue to watch our children die. The NRA and its supporters have decided the **Second** **Amendment** is more important not only than our children’s lives, but than our very concept of liberty in the United States.
It must be checked, before it consumes the freedoms it was conceived to protect."
2020-10-10 18:06:33,edition.cnn.com,11.112936,?,Barrett's confirmation could help the Supreme Court take rare action on gun rights,"Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court has gone a decade without acting on a major case concerning the **Second** **Amendment**, an issue that could receive rare attention in the future by the high court should Judge Amy Coney Barrett be confirmed to the bench in the coming weeks.
The appeals court, Barrett said at the time, ""treats the **Second** **Amendment** as a **second**-class right.""
Should the Senate confirm Barrett, who once clerked for Scalia, she could provide the extra vote Justice Clarence Thomas has been advocating for to take up **Second** **Amendment** cases.
""We saw earlier this year that, even though four of the current justices are ready to take up a number of **Second** **Amendment** cases, they weren't sure if they had a fifth vote on the merits -- because they weren't sure about the chief justice, "" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
""It seems likely that the confirmation of Judge Barrett would remove that uncertainty and open the pipeline to a flurry of cases, perhaps ranging from the constitutionality of criminal felon-in-possession statutes to large-capacity magazine bans,"" Vladeck added.
In the 2019 case on the 7th Circuit, the majority found that a federal and Wisconsin law barring convicted felons from possessing a firearm did not violate the **Second** **Amendment**.
Barrett did a deep-dive in her dissent into the origins of the **Second** **Amendment** and applied it to Scalia's opinion in Heller, one of the most significant gun rights cases in modern history,
Barrett concluded in Kanter v. Barr that while the founders may have favored limiting gun rights for people posing a danger to society, a blanket ban on felons was not rooted in historical precedent or writings.
""History is consistent with common sense: it demonstrates that legislatures have the power to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns,"" she wrote, applying an originalist approach that looked to the 18th-century intentions. ""But that power extends only to people who are dangerous. Founding legislatures did not strip felons of the right to bear arms simply because of their status as felons.""
Originalism was the hallmark of Scalia's jurisprudence -- it is the doctrine that demands justices decipher the original meanings of texts in order to determine whether someone's rights are violated. To that end, the majority of Barrett's 37-page dissent in Kanter is devoted to exploring the history of gun regulations for convicted criminals in the 1700s and 1800s.
Barrett repeatedly referenced the country's founders and their intentions when ratifying the **Second** **Amendment**, saying they ""would not have assumed that a free man, previously convicted, lived in a society without any rights and without the protection of the law.""
Those rights include the right to bear arms, and Barrett argued that it was a high bar for modern legislatures to restrict that right.
Barrett also invoked two current conservative justices in the final line of her dissent, warning that the **Second** **Amendment** was in danger of becoming a ""**second**-class right.""
""Holding that the ban is constitutional ... does not put the government through its paces, but instead treats the **Second** **Amendment** as a **second**-class right,"" she wrote.
JUST WATCHED Understanding John Roberts' surprising streak of liberal wins Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Understanding John Roberts' surprising streak of liberal wins 03:16
The line directly quoted from the plurality opinion Justice Samuel Alito authored in McDonald v. Chicago , a follow-up to Heller that affirmed an individual's right to possess and carry weapons applied on the state and local level as well as federally.
While Barrett quoted Alito, it may have also been a nod to Thomas, one of the most conservative justices currently on the bench, who slammed the court for not taking up a gun rights case out of Illinois in 2015. Thomas turned the words of Alito into a criticism of the Court, stating, ""I would grant certiorari to prevent the Seventh Circuit from relegating the **Second** **Amendment** to a **second**-class right.""
An NRA-approved nominee
Already, Barrett has the backing of the National Rifle Association, the nation's largest gun rights organization.
In a statement issued the same day Trump unveiled his nominee last month, the group said it ""fully supports"" Barrett and urged the Republican-controlled Senate to ""act swiftly to confirm her.""
""Judge Barrett's record demonstrates a steadfast commitment to the fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution,"" the group said. ""With this nomination, President Trump continues his record of nominating qualified, fair-minded federal judges who respect the Bill of Rights - including the **Second** **Amendment** - to our nation's highest court.""
The NRA had also supported the nomination of Trump's two other Supreme Court appointees: Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.
But while the conservative jurist received praise from supporters of gun rights, she also got harsh criticism from two major gun control groups, one of which warned that her confirmation could endanger Americans.
""Amy Coney Barrett's alarming interpretation of the **Second** **Amendment** would make her an ideal Supreme Court Justice for the NRA, but a terrible one for the safety of the American people,"" said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action.
""Giving her a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court will make us all less safe,"" Watts said."
2018-03-28 11:10:01,vox.com,11.106506,Lean Left,Trump: “THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED!”,"President Donald Trump has responded to retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens’s op-ed calling to repeal the **Second** **Amendment** — and he is not a fan.
“THE **SECOND** **AMENDMENT** WILL NEVER BE REPEALED!” Trump tweeted on Wednesday. “As much as Democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, NO WAY. We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!”
There are several problems with this tweet.
For one, Stevens is a lifelong Republican who was appointed by Republican President Gerald Ford.
Stevens’s views also do not reflect the views of most Democrats. Mainstream Democratic lawmakers are careful to caution that they want to regulate guns within the bounds of the **Second** **Amendment**. Even activists say the same thing; March for Our Lives leaders David Hogg and Sam Fuentes, for example, have both said that they are not against the **Second** **Amendment**.
This seems to reflect the opinion of most Democrats: A survey by the Economist and YouGov, conducted in February, found that 39 percent of Democrats want to repeal the **Second** **Amendment**, while 41 percent do not. (The rest — 20 percent — were not sure.)
Even if there was more support for repealing the **Second** **Amendment**, keeping the Supreme Court in conservative hands, as Trump suggests, would not do anything to stop a repeal. Repealing the **Second** **Amendment** would require super-majorities of Congress and state legislatures. The Supreme Court does not enter into that process.
Trump’s tweet does expose one problem with calls to repeal the **Second** **Amendment**: They may give ammo to opponents of gun control. This is something Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and author of Gunfight, warned about on Twitter following Stevens’s op-ed:
Stevens’s call to repeal the 2A is not only ineffective but worse: it makes it even harder to pass good gun laws today. It plays right into the hands of the @nra which can now point to this op-ed and say, “See, we told you they want to take away your rights and your guns.” — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
The @NRA says that anyway of course but Stevens gives them evidence to vote when critics object. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018
You see this kind of thing time and time again in the gun debate: Activists and lawmakers propose mild measures for gun control, like universal background checks, that have near-universal support — topping 75 percent even among Republicans. The NRA argues that if Congress is allowed to do this, it will only be the first step toward far more restrictive laws — insinuating that the real interest of gun control advocates is a full repeal of the **Second** **Amendment** and full government seizure of all guns in the US. Through these fears, calls for even mild measures die.
This is why conservative outlets like Breitbart made such a big deal of March for Our Lives organizer Delaney Tarr’s comments that “[w]hen you give us an inch, that bump stocks ban, we will take a mile.”
As Winkler acknowledged, this is something that the NRA and gun rights groups are going to try anyway. But with op-eds like Stevens’s, they have proof that people on the other side of this issue really are interested in something that goes much further.
Calls for repeal could still help shift the Overton window on guns, broadening what’s acceptable in public discourse. After all, the NRA has long worked against policies, like universal background checks, that are enormously popular with the American people. Perhaps an equal counterweight on the other side could, overall, push the US closer to the middle ground that most Americans support.
But for now, the op-ed has given reason for another Trump tweet making it seem like Americans’ **Second** **Amendment** rights are under siege."

Fox News has obtained a copy of Donald Trump’s upcoming book, in which he addresses a touchy subject: His net worth. The real estate magnate turned reality TV star turned Birther presidential wanna-be has never been keen on disclosing his true wealth—probably because it’s not as impressive as he’d like us to believe. In 2006, **Trump** sued a journalist who’d reported that he was only worth between $150 and $250 million; **Trump** claimed he was worth at least $2.7 billion.
Now, according to Trump’s book, he’s worth more than $7 billion. Of that, $3 billion is the value of the **Trump** brand, i.e., his name.
How do you get your name to be worth a purported $3 billion? First, you slap it onto every kind of product imaginable, from hotels to perfume to a vanity beer label. Here’s a selection from the more than 200 trademark applications The Donald™ has filed in his own name:

2016-08-13 19:49:44,nbcnews.com,3.3619208,Lean Left,Four Takeaways From the Latest Battleground Polls,"Seven news battleground polls, seven states where Hillary Clinton holds a lead against Donald **Trump**.
Those are the results from the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls, which found Hillary Clinton ahead in Iowa (by four points), Ohio (by five), Florida (by five), North Carolina (by nine), Pennsylvania (by 11), Virginia (by 13) and Colorado (by 14).
If those poll numbers hold with another three months to go until Election Day 2016, **Trump** won’t have a realistic path to 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.
But there are four other takeaways from the new battleground polling. Call them the four different gaps:
1. The Education Gap
With one exception (Florida), Clinton is leading in every battleground among college-educated white voters, while she’s losing among whites without a college degree. Why is this significant? As the Atlantic’s Ron Brownstein has noted, no Democratic presidential candidate going back to 1952 has won among college-educated whites. (All poll numbers below are among registered voters)
Colorado
Whites with a college degree: Clinton 55%, **Trump** 23% (D+32)
Whites without: **Trump** 43%, Clinton 32% (R+11)
Florida
Whites with a college degree: **Trump** 42%, Clinton 40% (R+2)
Whites without: **Trump** 50%, Clinton 32% (R+18)
Iowa
Whites with a college degree: Clinton 56%, **Trump** 25% (D+31)
Whites without: **Trump** 42%, Clinton 35% (R+7)
North Carolina
Whites with a college degree: Clinton 47%, **Trump** 40% (D+7)
Whites without: **Trump** 60%, Clinton 23% (R+37)
Ohio
Whites with a college degree: Clinton 45%, **Trump** 37% (D+8)
Whites without: **Trump** 49%, Clinton 31% (R+18)
Pennsylvania
Whites with a college degree: Clinton 53%, **Trump** 32% (D+21)
Whites without: **Trump** 50%, Clinton 34% (R+16)
Virginia
Whites with a college degree: Clinton 43%, **Trump** 37% (D+6)
Whites without: **Trump** 48%, Clinton 28% (R+20)
2. The Urban-vs.-Rural Gap
Relatedly, Clinton is drubbing **Trump** in urban areas and suburbs, while **Trump** is ahead in rural areas. The problem for **Trump**: For the most part, there are many more voters in these urban areas than rural ones.
Colorado
Denver-Eastern Suburbs: Clinton 60%, **Trump** 20% (D+40)
Western Suburbs: Clinton 55%, **Trump** 20% (D+35)
East: **Trump** 44%, Clinton 42% (R+2)
Southern Front Range: **Trump** 51%, Clinton 28% (R+23)

Florida
North/Panhandle: **Trump** 52%, Clinton 33% (R+19)
Orlando/Central Atlantic Coast: Clinton 51%, **Trump** 32% (D+19)
Tampa Bay Area: Clinton 46%, **Trump** 35% (R+11)
Gulf Coast/Mid-Florida: **Trump** 47%, Clinton 34% (R+13)
Miami/Gold Keys: Clinton 51%, **Trump** 32% (D+19)
Iowa
Eastern Cities: Clinton 45%, **Trump** 31% (D+14)
East Central: Clinton 47%, **Trump** 33% (D+14)
Des Moines Area: Clinton 44%, **Trump** 30% (D+14)
Central: **Trump** 46%, Clinton 34% (R+12)
West: **Trump** 51%, Clinton 31% (R+20)
North Carolina
East: Clinton 41%, **Trump** 41% (even)
Raleigh-Durham Triangle: Clinton 61%, **Trump** 28% (D+33)
Charlotte Area: Clinton 53%, **Trump** 34% (D+19)
Piedmont Central: Clinton 44%, **Trump** 44% (even)
West: Clinton 44%, **Trump** 43% (D+1)
Ohio
Cleveland area: Clinton 58%, **Trump** 23% (D+35)
North: Clinton 41%, **Trump** 40% (D+1)
Ohio Valley & West: **Trump** 45%, Clinton 32% (R+13)
Columbus area: Clinton 49%, **Trump** 35% (D+14)
Cincinnati/Dayton: **Trump** 44%, Clinton 40% (R+4)
Pennsylvania
Philadelphia: Clinton 71%, **Trump** 19% (D+52)
Philly burbs: Clinton 52%, **Trump** 26% (D+26)

Central: **Trump** 53%, Clinton 31% (R+22)
West: Clinton 53%, **Trump** 36% (D+17)
Virginia
DC Suburbs: Clinton 63%, **Trump** 21% (D+42)
Northern Virginia Exurbs: Clinton 39%, **Trump** 36% (D+3)
Central/West: **Trump** 44%, Clinton 38% (R+6)
Richmond/East: Clinton 44%, **Trump** 34% (D+10)
Tidewater: Clinton 50%, **Trump** 31% (D+19)
3. The Gender Gap
Clinton is winning women by larger margins than **Trump** is winning among men. And Clinton is even winning among men in Colorado and Virginia.
Colorado
Men: Clinton 42%, **Trump** 34% (D+8)
Women: Clinton 50%, **Trump** 31% (D+19)
Florida
Men: **Trump** 41%, Clinton 40% (R+1)
Women: Clinton 47%, **Trump** 37% (D+10)
Iowa
Men: **Trump** 43%, Clinton 33% (R+10)
Women: Clinton 49%, **Trump** 32% (D+17)
North Carolina
Men: **Trump** 43%, Clinton 42% (R+1)
Women: Clinton 53%, **Trump** 34% (D+19)
Ohio
Men: **Trump** 42%, Clinton 41% (R+1)
Women: Clinton 45%, **Trump** 35% (D+10)
Pennsylvania
Men: **Trump** 44%, Clinton 40% (R+4)
Women: Clinton 55%, **Trump** 30% (D+25)
Virginia
Men: Clinton 40%, **Trump** 39% (D+1)
Women: Clinton 52%, **Trump** 28% (D+24)
4. The Party Unity Gap
In all seven states, Democrats are backing Clinton by a larger margin than Republicans are behind **Trump** – sometimes by wide margins.
Colorado
Among Democrats: Clinton 91%, **Trump** 4% (D+87)
Among Republicans: **Trump** 79%, Clinton 7% (R+72)
Florida
Among Democrats: Clinton 92%, **Trump** 4% (D+88)
Among Republicans: **Trump** 79%, Clinton 6% (R+73)
Iowa
Among Democrats: Clinton 88%, **Trump** 4% (D+84)
Among Republicans: **Trump** 83%, Clinton 4% (R+79)
North Carolina
Among Democrats: Clinton 89%, **Trump** 7% (D+82)
Among Republicans: **Trump** 84%, Clinton 6% (R+78)
Ohio
Among Democrats: Clinton 87%, **Trump** 5% (D+82)
GOP: **Trump** 83%, Clinton 5% (R+78)
Pennsylvania
Among Democrats: Clinton 91%, **Trump** 5% (D+86)
Among Republicans: **Trump** 77%, Clinton 7% (R+70)
Virginia"
2018-05-17 18:22:23,thedailybeast.com,3.3416216,Center,Here Are 58 People Who Have Been Deemed ‘Trump Before Trump’,"When Rep. Lou Barletta emerged as the victor in the Pennsylvania Senate Republican primary on Tuesday night, it was widely observed that voters had gone with someone who was “**Trump** before **Trump**.” And for good reason. Barletta has backed some characteristically Trumpian proposals, such as his effort, as the mayor of Hazleton, to make English the town’s official language.
And yet, if Barletta (1) is a proto-Trumpian politician, what does one make of his fellow Pennsylvania Republican, House candidate Rick Saccone (2), who once declared, “I was **Trump** before **Trump** was **Trump**.” Can two Pennsylvania Republicans both be the incarnation of the president before the president was the president? And if so, how about three? Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial nominee Scott Wagner (3) was declared by the Pittsburgh Tribune to be “**Trump** before **Trump**” as well.
It is a testament to the degree to which **Trump** has taken his place at the center of the political universe that so many Republicans in Pennsylvania seems to want to adopt his image as their own. But Keystone State politicians are only the latest crop of wannabes to use the moniker.
Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (4) was “**Trump** before **Trump**” when he ran last year. Rep. Claudia Tenney (5) has been deemed one herself during her re-election campaign. Current Senate candidates Chris McDaniel (6), Joe Arpaio (7), and Corey Stewart (8) have pitched themselves as “**Trump** before **Trump**.” Just-failed Senate candidate Don Blankenship (9) was described as—you guessed it— “**Trump** before **Trump**.”
Before this cycle, others occupied the role of the president’s forebearer. Chris Christie (10) was called “**Trump** before **Trump**” because of his brashness (his lieutenant governor, current NJ secretary of state Kim Guadagno [11], has also earned the title). Jeff Sessions (12) was considered “**Trump** before **Trump**” because of his views on immigration. So too was former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer (13).
Newt Gingrich (14) was called “**Trump** before **Trump**” for….. some reason.
Rudy Giuliani (15) was “**Trump** before **Trump**” because he likes media and is a Republican from New York. Sarah Palin (16) was “**Trump** before **Trump**” because she was known as a populist simpleton. Mike Huckabee (17) was “**Trump** before **Trump** was **Trump**” because, as he put it: “a lot of the things that he’s saying, those are things that, in many ways, I’ve been saying those for eight years.” Ted Cruz (18) was pitched to voters as “**Trump** before **Trump** was cool” while former Rep. Joe Walsh (19) insisted that people came up to him to say “Joe, you were the local **Trump** before **Trump**.”
Paul LePage (20) was considered “**Trump** before **Trump**” because, well, he’s Paul LePage and yeah, the analogy works so F*&% OFF!
And if you dare question why LePage should earn that title let us introduce you to former congressman Michael Grimm (21) who will “break you in half like a boy” if you challenge his one-time labelling as a “**Trump** before **Trump**.” Being un-PC, indeed, seems to be a trait that gets you dubbed a “**Trump** before **Trump**,” which may be why failed gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino (22) has also earned the title.
But even some decidedly un-Trumpian Republicans have been saddled with the label. John McCain (23) and Darrell Issa (24) have all been dubbed “**Trump** before **Trump**,” the latter courtesy of former president Barack Obama.
Nor is the title limited to currently serving—or even living—politicians. George H.W. Bush (25), Lyndon Johnson (26), William Jennings Bryan (27), Barry Goldwater (28), George Wallace (29), Huey Long (30), Ross Perot (31), and Pete Wilson (32) were all deemed “**Trump** before **Trump**.” The more vaunted “**Trump** before **Trump** was **Trump**” title was reserved for two men in particular: Pat Buchanan (33), who ran a prototype Trumpian presidential campaign, and Jesse Ventura (34), once nearly launched a presidential bid alongside **Trump**.
Even some liberal Democrats have earned the “**Trump** before **Trump**” title, such as former Sen. Harry Reid (35).
All of which raises the question: Who, actually, was **Trump** himself before **Trump** was **Trump**?
“He is a hybrid,” Sam Nunberg, Trump’s former aide, told The Daily Beast. “I would say, politically, he plays Reagan but he is really Nixon and Bill Clinton with a dash of Ross Perot. And I think the big influences on him are Roy Cohn, Roger Stone, his father, [PR giant] Howard Rubenstein, Vince McMahon, Don King, and Howard Stern. But at the end of the day, it is really just him. He’s a unique guy. There is only one of him.”
With such a wide-swath of influences in Trump’s life, perhaps it’s not at all surprising that prominent media personalities have also been dubbed “**Trump** before **Trump**” figures.
Laura Ingraham (36) is one Fox host that has earned that title. Lou Dobbs (37) is another. Andrew Breitbart (38) was remembered on the anniversary of his death as “**Trump** before **Trump**.” And Breitbart’s protege Steve Bannon (39), who helped elect **Trump** during the 2016 election, was described as “**Trump** before **Trump**” for creating “the political philosophy and the political army in waiting that has been the engine for the candidate’s astonishing rise.”
Even MSNBC host Chris Matthews (40) has been called “**Trump** before **Trump**” though no explanation was offered as to why.
Being “**Trump** before **Trump**” isn’t a domestic phenomenon. The cliche stretches across the globe. France’s Marine Le Pen (41), Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi (42), Israel’s Bibi Netanyahu (43), India’s Narendra Modi (44), Japan’s Shinzo Abe (45), Russia’s Vladimir Zhirinovsky (46), Switzerland’s Christoph Blocher (47), Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez (48), Hungary’s Viktor Orban (49), Canada’s Stephen Harper (50), Argentina’s Carlos Menem (51), and Great Britain’s Enoch Powell (52) have all been described, at various junctures, as “**Trump** before **Trump**.”
It was perhaps inevitable that the infamous late Toronto mayor Rob Ford (53) would also earn the “**Trump** before **Trump**” honorific. RIP.
Tired of this list yet? In **Trump**-before-**Trump**-ian fashion, we give you MORE.
How about reality TV star Jim Bob Duggar (54), Italian proto-fascist author Gabriele D’Annunzio (55), New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (56), Cincinnati sheriff Rick Jones (57), and one-time Delaware House candidate Fred Cullis (58)? All of them, Trumps before **Trump**.
So which one of the 58 is most accurately described as a **Trump** precursor?
“None,” says Nunberg. “It is like saying who was Tom Cruise before Tom Cruise or who was The Rock before The Rock?”
**Trump**, he added, borrowing a quote from Roger Stone, “is a giant among pygmies.”"

2020-03-03 15:00:00,vox.com,3.3327236,Lean Left,Super Tuesday live results: Trump faces few real challengers in Republican primary,"President **Trump** has won the first of multiple state-level contests on Super Tuesday, and is expected to win the rest — continuing his march to winning the Republican nomination for the presidency this summer.
Thirteen states held GOP presidential primaries on March 3. While Virginia held a Democratic presidential primary on Super Tuesday, the state’s Republican Party voted to cancel its primary in fall 2019 and hold a preference vote instead to protect Trump’s nomination (several states did the same in 2004, and at least five others have in 2020). **Trump** had already won 86 of the 1,276 delegates he’ll need to clinch the nomination, and on Tuesday, he will almost certainly have gained another 794 by the time all votes are tallied.
His closest challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, had just one delegate heading into Super Tuesday, but said in an interview with Reason Magazine’s Matt Welch that he had no plans to drop out of the race.
In some states — like Arkansas, Texas, and California — **Trump** and Weld were joined by perennial candidate Roque “Rocky” De La Fuente, a San Diego businessman who ran for Senate in nine states in 2018, and Zoltan Istvan, an advocate for transhumanism who describes himself as a “cyborg” and has campaigned on the slogan “Upgrade America.”
Here are the results of the GOP Super Tuesday primaries, thanks to our friends at Decision Desk:
Below are the states that held GOP primary contests on Tuesday and the most recent polling in each one (if it exists), as well as Trump’s approval rating according to Morning Consult. Interestingly, Trump’s approval has declined in every Super Tuesday state since his inauguration, from 10 points in Colorado to 31 points in Vermont.

2020-05-26 20:55:08,theblaze.com,6.9010367,Right,Here are the 10 states where the share of COVID deaths coming from nursing homes are the highest,"We've all heard about the disproportionate share of **COVID**-19 deaths happening in America's nursing homes.
A recently reported study from the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity showed that while only 0.6% of Americans live in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, that population makes up more than 42% of the nation's **COVID**-19 deaths.
The topic has been used to bludgeon some elected leadership — especially New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. One of the biggest attacks on Cuomo has been his role in some 5,000 deaths in his state's nursing homes following his March 25 executive order forcing nursing homes to accept coronavirus-positive people.
But did you know New York's reported nursing home deaths as a share of the state's **COVID**-19 deaths are the lowest in the nation? The Empire State has seen 13.8% of its **COVID**-19 deaths in nursing homes. (However, some analysts have pointed out that New York's reporting might not be accurate.) The second-lowest rate so far is Nevada's 23.9%, according to a newly updated FREOPP report.
In fact, because New York is such an outlier considering its high share of overall coronavirus cases and deaths as well as its data reporting methods, if the state's data is removed from the calculations, the nursing home share of **COVID**-19 deaths nationwide jumps to 52%.
What's happening in the states?
So, which states are seeing the highest share of **COVID**-19 deaths in their long-term care facilities?
FREOPP looked at state-by-state data, and found that, among states that break out deaths by residential categories, about 60% of them have seen more than half of their **COVID**-19 fatalities come from nursing homes.
Only two states — the aforementioned New York and Nevada — have seen less than a third of their **COVID**-19 deaths come from nursing homes.
Below are the states where nursing home deaths are the greatest share of **COVID**-19 deaths.
No word yet on how the leadership in these states will be held accountable.
Top 10 states where the share of **COVID**-19 deaths coming from nursing homes are the highest

2020-05-26 19:07:47,thefederalist.com,6.853791,Lean Right,Gov. Whitmer's Nursing Home Response In Michigan Mimics Andrew Cuomo's Mistakes In New York,"Michigan’s Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced a new executive order directing nursing homes on how to care for **COVID**-19 patients. The orders looks eerily similar to New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s advisory requiring elderly people with positive **COVID**-19 diagnosis be readmitted to nursing facilities.
Whitmer’s own Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) Director Robert Gordon sounded the alarm on the new executive order and the inaccurate measurements of **COVID**-19 related deaths emerging from Michigan nursing homes.
During a Michigan Senate Oversight Committee hearing, Gordon said he does not believe Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer when she reported 687 nursing home deaths via **COVID**-19. Gordon claims the number is an “undercount.”
“That number is **COVID** related deaths that have been reported, I do not stand behind that number as an accurate and full accounting of **COVID** related nursing home deaths and I wouldn’t want us to present it that way… I think that number is probably, in fact, I’m confident that number is an undercount,” Gordon said.
Across the United States, nursing homes and assisted living facilities account for 42 percent of **COVID**-19 deaths. It is impossible to tell the percentage of nursing home deaths in the state as Michigan is among eight other states that do not record deaths by residential category, according to the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity (FREOPP).
Fortunately, one state with near-identical policies gives us insight into the disaster coming for Michigan’s most vulnerable communities.
On March 25, New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a controversial advisory demanding hospitals discharge elderly patients with **COVID**-19 back to nursing homes. The advisory was built to combat alleged “discrimination” of those with **COVID**-19.
“No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to [nursing homes] solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of **COVID**-19,” the advisory reads.
Whitmer mimicked New York’s advisory to combat alleged discrimination and insisted a long-term care facility cannot prohibit readmission of a resident based on **COVID**-19 testing results.
“A long-term care facility must not prohibit admission or readmission of a resident based on **COVID**-19 testing requirements or results in a manner that is inconsistent with this order,” Whitmer’s new executive order reads.
In her new executive order, Whitmer also instituted the creation of “regional hubs” for **COVID**-19 affected residents. These are designated nursing homes that will act as a conglomerate for other nursing homes that do not provide a designated **COVID**-19 unit. Some nursing homes will rid their facilities of **COVID**-19 patients, while others create a full-blown hub.
“If the long-term care facility does not have a dedicated unit, it must attempt to transfer the **COVID**-19-affected resident to a regional hub, an alternate care facility with physical and operational capacity to care for the resident, or an available swing bed at a hospital,” the order reads.
The Traverse City Record-Eagle reported state officials do not see fit to require extra inspections of nursing homes that sign on to receive **COVID**-19 patients as regional hub facilities. The governor’s order means care facilities with no **COVID**-19 patients will be treated the same as care facilities with the entire region’s conglomerate of elderly **COVID**-19 patients.
**COVID**-19 has plagued nursing homes and elderly care facilities disproportionately. The virus has killed upwards of 10,500 residents in facilities nationwide or approximately one-fifth of the U.S. coronavirus death toll. Cuomo’s and Whitmer’s decisions to force nursing homes to care for **COVID**-19 patients are to blame for the increasing numbers and atrocity among the nation’s most vulnerable population."
2020-04-15 15:04:18,cnbc.com,6.812373,Center,New York City struggles to get accurate fatality count as more people die at home,"New York City is struggling to get an accurate count of the number of **Covid**-19 fatalities as more people die at home and some likely coronavirus deaths are attributed to heart attacks and other causes, Mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledged Wednesday.
On Tuesday, New York City officials said they would begin counting ""probable"" **Covid**-19 deaths, which are people ""who had no known positive laboratory test,"" but are believed to have died due to **Covid**-19. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene estimates that there have been 3,778 probable **Covid**-19 deaths since March 11 that weren't previously counted in the city's official tally. There have been 6,589 confirmed **Covid**-19 deaths in New York City so far.
""I want the whole truth out. Wherever the facts take us, I want the whole truth out,"" de Blasio said Wednesday at a news briefing. ""Absolutely, I believe there are more people who died because of **Covid**-19, in one way or another, because of something that happened to them related to **Covid**-19.""
New York City has had to prioritize coronavirus testing due to a scarcity of test kits and the supplies needed to analyze them, de Blasio has previously said. As a result, testing has gone largely to those who are already in the hospital and first responders, according to de Blasio. People exhibiting symptoms consistent with **Covid**-19 but who remain at home may not be tested and thus excluded from the official count of cases — even if they die.
De blasio has repeatedly emphasized that the city is operating on a ""wartime dynamic,"" meaning that officials are making decisions rapidly as the situation evolves. He said the decision to report probable **Covid**-19 deaths was made to be more transparent with the public about the magnitude of the outbreak.
NYC Health Department Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said most people who have died from **Covid**-19 were diagnosed in hospitals. However, the city has seen significantly more people dying at home than usual, Barbot said.
Barbot said the city has compared ""the number of deaths during that same time period in the previous year and what we find is that there are roughly 3,000 deaths above what would have been anticipated.""
In the first five days of April, the number of people who died in their homes or on the street in New York City was more than eight times the deaths recorded during the same period last year, The New York Times reported, citing the New York Fire Department.
The official count could also be missing patients who suffered from other illnesses. Barbot called for more research into how **Covid**-19 interacts with other illnesses. For example, she said some people who have died after having a heart attack but also exhibited **Covid**-19 symptoms might be missed in the official tally.
""Are there potentially cases where someone registered a death as a heart attack because the person hadn't yet developed symptoms of **Covid**-19 and truly should have been categorized as a **Covid** probable?"" she said. ""I don't know if we'll ever be able to answer that question fully, but I think it's something that still needs to be looked into further.""
Dr. J Mocco, Director of Mt. Sinai's Cerebrovascular Center in New York City, which handles stroke patients, told CNBC that there's an emerging base of evidence to indicate that **Covid**-19 exacerbates strokes and potentially other medical conditions.
""We're seeing more strokes than before and they are a large percent **Covid** positive,"" he said. ""We had five patients over a two-week time period who were 49 years old or younger, which is not standard, who had no other risk factors except for being **Covid** positive.""
Mocco said it's possible that people are suffering strokes and staying at home out of fear of catching **Covid**-19 in the hospital, but they might already have the disease and it could even be a cause of the stroke. Such patients would not be tested for **Covid**-19 and thus could be missed by the city's official tally. Mocco's team at Mt. Sinai, in the epicenter of the U.S. **Covid**-19 outbreak, continues to research how the respiratory disease interacts with other illnesses.

2020-10-25 15:30:00,vox.com,6.771537,Lean Left,Trump’s pandemic rallies spread coronavirus infection and misinformation,"With the pandemic getting worse, not better, President Donald Trump tried to turn reality on its head during a series of rallies on Saturday in North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin.
“We’re rounding the turn. Our numbers are incredible,” Trump claimed in Lumberton, North Carolina, before blasting the media for its alleged fear-mongering.
But the US is not rounding a turn for the better. Friday and Saturday saw new daily coronavirus infections in the US surge past 80,000 for the first time ever. And it’s not just cases — hospitalizations are up more than 33 percent over the last month, and the seven-day average of deaths is now back above 800.
“That’s all I hear about now. Turn on television, ‘**Covid**, **Covid**, **Covid** **Covid** **Covid**.’ A plane goes down, 500 people dead, they don’t talk about it. ‘**Covid** **Covid** **Covid** **Covid**.’ By the way, on November 4, you won’t hear about it anymore,” Trump said. (In case it’s not clear, the plane crash he referred to was made up.)
""That's all I hear about now. Turn on TV, '**Covid**, **Covid**, **Covid** **Covid** **Covid**.' A plane goes down, 500 people dead, they don't talk about it. '**Covid** **Covid** **Covid** **Covid**.' By the way, on November 4th, you won't hear about it anymore ... 'please don't go and vote, **Covid**!'"" -- Trump pic.twitter.com/1bh7x2RSTy — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 24, 2020
Trump invoked a nearly identical talking point a couple hours later in Circleville, Ohio, saying, “You know what? On November 4, you’re not gonna hear— the news, CNN, all they talk about, ‘**Covid** **Covid** **Covid**.’ If a plane goes down with 500 people, they don’t talk about ... they’re trying to scare everybody.”
Then, on Saturday night in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Trump argued, falsely, that the main reason cases in the US are going up is because the US does so much testing — “if we did half the testing, we’d have half the cases,” he said, as if testing causes cases — and insisted the coronavirus is “going away.” (In recent weeks, new cases have actually grown at a much faster rate than testing has expanded.)

Trump echoed the same theme during his first rally of the day on Sunday in Londonderry, New Hampshire.

Not only is Trump’s rhetoric irresponsible, but the fact is, he’s holding rallies that make a mockery of social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines recommended by his own government. And these rallies appear to be actively making the pandemic worse by spreading the virus.
Perhaps the strongest evidence of this came on Friday, when Erin Mansfield, Josh Salman, and Dinah Voyles Pulver authored a piece for USA Today that examined how coronavirus cases surged in a number of places where Trump recently held rallies.
From the article:
The president has participated in nearly three dozen rallies since mid-August, all but two at airport hangars. A USA TODAY analysis shows **COVID**-19 cases grew at a faster rate than before after at least five of those rallies in the following counties: Blue Earth, Minnesota; Lackawanna, Pennsylvania; Marathon, Wisconsin; Dauphin, Pennsylvania; and Beltrami, Minnesota. Together, those counties saw 1,500 more new cases in the two weeks following Trump’s rallies than the two weeks before – 9,647 cases, up from 8,069.
But to the extent that Trump actually engages with this reality, his message is that people have to learn to live with it.
“You have to lead your life, and you have to get out,” he advised his fans on Saturday in Ohio.
The White House has no plan — and they aren’t even trying to hide it
Beyond the mounting human toll — more than 220,000 Americans have now died from the coronavirus — the latest spike in cases comes at a politically inopportune time for the White House, with Election Day now just nine days away.
But at this point, the Trump administration isn’t even pretending to have a plan to slow the spread of the virus. Instead, during a CNN interview on Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said, revealingly, that “we’re not going to control the pandemic.”
MEADOWS: We're not going to control the pandemic
TAPPER: Why not?
M: Because it's a contagious virus
T: Why not make efforts to contain it?
M: What we need to do is make sure we have the proper mitigation factors to make sure people don't die pic.twitter.com/0DYgk4rB3T — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 25, 2020
Meanwhile, the White House is dealing with yet another cluster of cases — five people close to Vice President Mike Pence have tested positive for the virus in recent days. Pence, the chair of the White House coronavirus task force, was exposed. But instead of following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, which calls for exposed people to self-quarantine for 14 days, he plans to travel to pandemic rallies on Sunday and Monday.
So not only has the White House given up on protecting the American public, but Trump administration officials have failed to protect themselves. And Trump and Pence are actively making things worse by lying to the American public about the state of the pandemic at rallies that fuel further spread."
2020-12-15 16:20:00,vox.com,6.735847,Lean Left,"The many strange long-term symptoms of Covid-19, explained","When Heather-Elizabeth Brown spiked a fever in April in Detroit, the only reason she was able to get a coronavirus test was because she was volunteering as a police chaplain and was therefore considered an essential worker. Her results came back negative, and she was relieved. But then, she says, “I just got sicker and sicker.”
After being turned away from overcrowded ERs twice, Brown was eventually admitted on her third try. She finally tested positive, and by that point, she was severely ill. She was put on a ventilator and spent the next 31 days in a medically induced coma.
Before **Covid**-19, Brown was a healthy, active Black woman in her 30s. “But when I came off the ventilator, they had to coach me how to breathe.” The smallest pleasures — like eating a sliver of ice after her feeding tube was removed — became something to treasure.
Six months later, Brown is still very ill. She has been hospitalized for blood clots and has lingering heart problems, nerve pain, and extreme fatigue. “Even making breakfast is now out of the question,” she says. Most troublingly, she’s still experiencing severe brain fog, which makes it hard for her to return to work.
Brown is just one of many previously healthy people whose life has been derailed after a **Covid**-19 infection. While early research on **Covid**-19 focused on its respiratory symptoms, we now know its impacts — both direct and indirect — can be much more extensive and relentless.
On December 3, the National Institutes of Health held a two-day seminar on what has come to be called long **Covid**, or long-haul **Covid** — cases of lingering symptoms that can last for weeks or months after an initial infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently created a list of some of the persistent symptoms patients are experiencing, which include chest pain, brain fog, fatigue, and hair loss — with patients reporting many others as well.
Because these patients don’t all have the same symptoms, they will need different kinds of post-**Covid** care. And the NIH made clear that there are still many more questions than answers — including whose symptoms might linger for months, and how to treat them.
Almost a year into the pandemic, there have not yet been thorough, large-scale studies to determine the true prevalence of long **Covid**. But preliminary research suggests that somewhere between 10 percent and 88 percent of **Covid**-19 patients will experience at least one symptom for many weeks or months. Some of these can be life-altering; one study found that 50 percent of non-ICU patients reported a significant change to their cognitive functioning.
Doctors at the seminar said they were surprised by the scope of long **Covid** and its potential socioeconomic impacts. “This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who spoke at the event.
Related A doctor on 9 things that could go wrong with the new vaccines
Even if the prevalence ends up being on the lower end of the 10 to 88 percent range, the sheer volume of people getting sick means there are already millions of Americans who have, and will soon have, long **Covid**. Despite the staggering numbers, “we’re a hidden group of people,” Brown says. This can make getting treatment from skeptical physicians challenging. Long-**Covid** patient Anthony Campbell, for example, had a doctor refuse to sign a work disability form unless he was treated for anxiety rather than for his persistent symptoms.
Interviews with dozens of patients like Brown and Campbell provide a closer look at long Covid’s devastating impact — and the clues the latest research offers into what might be causing all these symptoms, including erectile dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, hallucinations, and dementia-like effects that can severely impact daily life.
Menstrual changes and erectile dysfunction
One of the most surprising new findings about long Covid’s effects is that both women and men have reported sexual and reproductive system symptoms following a **Covid**-19 infection.
The Patient-Led Research Group, a team of researchers who are also **Covid**-19 patients, conducted a survey of 640 long-**Covid** patients and recorded more than 200 total symptoms, including testicular pain, urinary problems, and menstrual changes.
“A lot of people with long **Covid** notice that their symptoms get worse just before their period happens,” when estrogen levels are lowest, says Louise Newson, a general practitioner and menopause specialist. She says an additional sign hormones may be involved are long-**Covid** symptoms like “brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, joint pain — these are also symptoms of menopause.”
Newson has 842 patient responses so far to a pilot survey, and she says the results “confirm my thoughts that long **Covid** is likely to be related to low hormone levels (estrogen and testosterone), which so far have been neglected with research.” Estrogen plays a key role in women’s health, and having abnormally low levels can lead to infertility, osteoporosis, lack of sex drive, and depression.
Newson says that anecdotally, patients with long **Covid** from her menopause clinic have improved with the right dose and type of hormone replacement therapy. “They all had low oestradiol and low testosterone results before treatment,” she says.
Long **Covid** can also significantly impact male reproductive systems and testosterone levels. “Absolutely, reproductive systems have been overlooked during the pandemic,” says Geoff Hackett, a professor of sexual medicine at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. He explains that during acute illness, the testes can be attacked by the virus directly.
“The testes are one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression,” writes the British Society of Sexual Medicine (BSSM) in its position paper on **Covid**-19. (This ACE2 enzyme is the primary way SARS-CoV-2 enters cells.) The BSSM adds that SARS-CoV-2 also damages cells on the inner surface of blood vessels called endothelial cells, a condition which is “frequently present in men with erectile dysfunction and testosterone deficiency.”
Several recent studies have pointed to testosterone, which in men is produced in the testes, as playing an important role in coronavirus patients: A study in Germany found that the majority of men admitted to the hospital with **Covid**-19 had low testosterone levels and high inflammatory markers. (This study was unable to determine if these low testosterone levels predated their coronavirus infection.)
A similar study in Italy found low testosterone levels predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients. A third study, in Wuhan, China, also found low testosterone levels in coronavirus patients, which they said required “more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.”
Hypogonadism, when sex organs don’t produce sufficient hormones, affects both the production of testosterone and sperm. Another recent paper, published in The Lancet, found the production of sperm was impaired in **Covid**-19 patients, which they said might be explained by an immune response in the testes. In some patients, they also found auto-immune orchitis, or inflammation of the testis with specific anti-sperm antibodies. “There does seem to be some evidence for relative infertility afterward,” Hackett says, though he cautions it’s too early to say if it would be permanent.
In general, “attacking the cells of the testes will have an adverse effect on erections,” Hackett says. Even beyond a direct effect, endothelial disorder and inflammation may affect the arteries in the penis, making erections more difficult. “Erectile dysfunction is going to be highly prevalent, particularly if you look at the groups at high risk of **Covid**-19,” Hackett says. “Seventy-five percent of diabetics have erectile dysfunction anyway.” Based on anecdotal evidence, the next Patient-Led Research Group survey will include questions on shrinkage, erectile dysfunction, and testicular pain.
Erectile function is a sign of overall health, and urologist Ryan Berglund of the Cleveland Clinic recently made a statement that for young and healthy people who develop this problem after having **Covid**-19, “this can be a sign of something more serious going on.”
The BSSM is concerned that these reproductive effects may have lasting implications, warning that low testosterone levels in men “are associated with increased mortality,” and that those “who may have survived the current pandemic ... may be at considerable risk from second and third wave infection, or future viral pandemics.”
Beyond **Covid**-19, research suggested a connection between viral infections of the central nervous system and pituitary dysfunction. A significant number of viruses have previously been associated with the onset of Type 1 diabetes, and it appears there may have been an increase in diabetes diagnoses during the pandemic.
Recognizing these impacts may help doctors find effective treatments; Hackett says a common erectile dysfunction treatment, Tadalafil, improves all markers of endothelial disease. “If it didn’t give men an erection, it would be treated as a serious cardiovascular drug,” he says. He notes that mountain climbers often take Tadalafil before big climbs to avoid altitude sickness, as it lowers pulmonary artery pressure and improves the endothelium of arteries — effects that might significantly help **Covid**-19 patients.
But Hackett says even as the UK National Health System rolls out long-**Covid** clinics, he’s been disappointed to see these symptoms overlooked. “Their strategies include things like eating healthy, hydrating, and mindfulness,” he says. “How is this going to go down with seriously ill people? All they’re offering is platitudes.”
Pulmonary problems
Long-**Covid** symptoms can be very diverse and are often not limited to one part of the body, making them hard to understand. One of the reasons long-**Covid** patients are struggling to do high-quality research through their illnesses, says Hannah Davis, a long-**Covid** patient and a member of the Patient-Led Research Group who helped design the survey, “is that we need answers.”
She’s tired of being told that no one knows how to help treat her symptoms, or how many others might be experiencing something similar. “We’re going to get answers faster than anyone else because we’re living this experience,” Davis says. One recent study of 201 long-**Covid** patients in the UK found that even in a young, low-risk population, 66 percent had impairments to one or more organs four months after their initial symptoms.
Being sick enough to be ventilated, like Brown was, often comes with its own complications; one study found that 81 percent of ventilated patients develop delirium, and one in five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome — a common lung condition in ICU patients — experience long-term cognitive impairment. But even coronavirus patients with milder symptoms or no initial symptoms at all can develop long **Covid**.
Long-term lung problems are perhaps the most straightforward long-**Covid** symptom, as the virus can directly inflame the lung tissue, filling air sacs with fluid and making them less elastic and harder to expand as you breathe. Even at the beginning of the pandemic, it was known that previous coronavirus epidemics had caused lung scarring in some patients. One 15-year study of 71 SARS patients from a 2003 outbreak found a third had reduced lung capacity; a third of MERS survivors in a 2017 study also had long-term lung damage.
New research suggests that around half of asymptomatic **Covid**-19 infections can also cause damage to the lungs.
In early November, a study published in The Lancet on 41 autopsies of **Covid**-19 patients offered a possible reason: It found that the virus caused major structural changes in the lungs, including extensive blood clotting, scarring of respiratory tissue, and the fusion of many smaller cells into larger cells. (Based on the fact that these were autopsies, these were all severe cases, limiting the implications that can be drawn.)
The authors suggest that, unlike other types of pneumonia, these structural changes may stem “from the persistence of infected and dysfunctional cells in the lungs” — which may help explain why some of these symptoms linger. Though we still don’t know the exact mechanics, continuing lung symptoms are perhaps the most common of them.
It’s still unclear how long these symptoms might last; some long-**Covid** patients have reported improvements in their breathing, although much slower than they would have liked. One study of mildly ill patients in China found that 70 percent had abnormal lung scans three months after their initial illness.
Blood clotting and other cardiovascular issues
Early in the pandemic, doctors noticed that many **Covid**-19 patients were having serious blood clotting problems, with reports of clogging dialysis machines and clots in the arms and legs called deep vein thromboses. But some patients, like Brown — who went back to the hospital with blood clots three months after her initial symptoms — are also experiencing clots weeks or months later.
Large blood clots can cause tissue damage, requiring amputations. Smaller clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impairing normal oxygen exchange. If clots travel to the brain or heart, they can also cause strokes or heart attacks, as 23-year-old Riley Behrens recently suffered after a coronavirus infection. “Before this, I was a healthy young athlete with no major medical conditions,” she tweeted after a **Covid**-related stroke. “Now, I’m being told I will likely never return to contact sports because of lasting lung and brain damage. The risk for a second stroke will always be there.”
It’s hard to know how common clotting problems are in **Covid**-19 patients, but reports of conditions linked to clotting have certainly increased: A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery recently found a twofold increase during the pandemic in major amputations, which are sometimes required after a clot is found. And multiple researchers have reported a spike in the number of stroke patients, including young people like Behrens who would not normally be at high risk for strokes, as well as in patients who didn’t know they’d had the coronavirus but later tested positive for antibodies.
A study published in Science in mid-November may have identified one of the reasons for this abnormal clotting: In half of 172 hospitalized coronavirus patients, the scientists found autoantibodies — proteins that are supposed to defend against invaders that instead start to attack the body’s own cells. When these autoantibodies were injected into lab mice, the animals developed blood clots. The researchers suggest that these proteins could be sparking a dangerous loop between clotting and hyperinflammation. A December preprint also found a significant percentage of **Covid**-19 patients developed autoantibodies, and the more severe their symptoms, the more autoantibodies they had.
But **Covid**-19’s cardiovascular impacts don’t end with coagulation. Half of 1,216 **Covid**-19 patients in one study also had heart abnormalities, and one in seven had severe cardiac issues.
“People can present without any lung symptoms, and have just heart or brain involvement,” says Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. These can include cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump; myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, the two thin layers of tissue that surround the heart and help it function. One study on 54 college athletes who’d had mild **Covid**-19 cases found that a third had pericarditis, even though about the same number had been asymptomatic.
Many long-**Covid** patients are also experiencing persistent heart concerns months after their initial illness. Kate Meredith of Beverly, Massachusetts, for example, first got sick in March. Now, she has tachycardia, or an abnormally elevated heart rate. “If I get up to do the dishes, it jumps to 140 [beats per minute],” she says.
Leticia Soares and Israel Slick, of Ontario, both also got **Covid**-19 in April. They each independently reported heart palpitations and tachycardia to the same doctor, who speculated Slick’s condition might be related to his **Covid**-19 infection, while Soares, who is Latina, was told to seek counseling. (Many Black and brown long-**Covid** patients say they’ve experienced gaslighting and medical racism when they try to seek treatment.)
Cardiovascular symptoms may arise from the coronavirus directly impacting the endothelium. These cells control vascular functions, including enzymes that direct blood clotting. The endothelium is also important for proper immune function, and its imbalance could help explain the cytokine storms seen in many patients with severe **Covid**-19 cases. “There’s no shortage of ways by which this virus can hurt the heart,” Topol concludes.
Immune system
Damaged endothelial cells can also stimulate mast cells, a type of blood cell that’s part of the immune system. Their job is to defend against foreign bodies by releasing chemicals like histamines. Activated mast cells were recently found in autopsies of **Covid**-19 patients and are linked to clots and pulmonary edemas.
Some long-**Covid** patients are reporting symptoms and inflammation similar to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a chronic, multisystem condition that causes allergic responses, GI problems, and neurological issues.
Frances Simpson, a psychology lecturer at Coventry University in the UK, says she and her 5- and 9-year old were infected with **Covid**-19 in March and have had long-**Covid** symptoms since, including new allergic reactions. “When you read about possible mast cell activation syndrome,” she says, “we can tick all of the symptoms off between us” — things like headaches, rashes, and extreme fatigue. Moreover, some of the drugs that have been shown to help with severe **Covid**-19 cases, like famotidine and aspirin, inhibit mast cell activation.
Immunology is very complicated, but it also appears that T cells, an important component of the immune system, may also play a role in long **Covid**, as they do in other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.
The CDC is now calling a particular set of inflammatory symptoms in multiple organs after an initial infection multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, or MIS-A — after a similar post-viral condition that was first reported in children, called MIS-C. Both children’s and adults’ symptoms in these cases overlap with MCAS, with problems like chest tightness, abdominal pain, rash, and inflammation, strengthening the argument that mast cells may be involved.
Nervous system
New research is also homing in on the many, sometimes severe, neurological symptoms that long-**Covid** patients have reported. One peer-reviewed paper found that a surprising 40 percent of patients with **Covid**-19 showed some kind of neurologic manifestation, and more than 30 percent had impaired cognition. These symptoms — including brain fog, extreme fatigue, difficulty with short-term memory, intense headaches, and tingling or numbness — are common in long-**Covid** patients.
Some long-**Covid** patients develop dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that can be triggered by viral infections. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions in our bodies such as heart rate and digestion. When it is damaged by an infection, these functions can go out of whack.
Davis, for example, has been diagnosed with a form of dysautonomia called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), where blood vessels don’t respond to chemical signals efficiently. When she stands, blood pools in her lower extremities, making her feel faint and exacerbating her brain fog. The nervous system continues to release hormones to tighten her non-responding blood vessels, increasing her heart rate and making her shake.
There’s also increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can actually cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of specialized cells that protect the brain, and harm the nervous system directly. In April, researchers found that a 40-year-old woman in Los Angeles with headaches, seizures, and hallucinations had RNA from the coronavirus in her cerebrospinal fluid.
One study recently found an explanation for how that may have occurred: The virus can directly enter and damage cells in the brain’s choroid plexus, which has cells with ACE2 receptors. “This can lead to leakage across this important barrier, that normally prevents entry of pathogens into the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain,” says study co-author Madeline Lancaster, a biologist and the group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.
The brain is normally protected from your blood, so it’s a big problem to have that barrier penetrated. During viral infections, many immune cells are activated and circulating through the body. Lancaster explains that even if the virus itself doesn’t get past the barrier, having “those inflammatory cytokines leak into the brain, where they really do not belong, can have serious repercussions.” One example is encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain itself, as found in this study of 12 **Covid**-19 patients in the UK.
Lancaster says viruses may penetrate the blood-brain barrier more often than previously thought. “The **Covid** crisis has shined a light on overlooked post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),” she says. “There’s a lot of indication that inflammation of the brain can lead to those symptoms. There’s a huge overlap between those conditions and long **Covid**.”
But though post-viral symptoms may linger for months or even years, it can be hard for doctors to find clues in neurological tests. While encephalitis can be seen on MRIs, damage to the cerebrospinal fluid might not be visible. (Doctors can, however, look for elevated biomarkers like cytokines.) “Unfortunately, that’s one of the reasons a lot of patients with CFS have been told it’s all in their heads. We’ve let those patients down,” says Lancaster.
Neuro-inflammation can cause emotional and behavioral changes. Sammie, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy, says she and her daughter were both infected in the UK with **Covid**-19 in March. Since then, her 15-year-old daughter has had headaches, dysautonomia, fatigue, and extreme anxiety and emotional outbursts. “She’s not a crier. She’s normally very stoic,” Sammie says, but over the last few months, “she’s had irrational outbursts, just sobbing her heart out.”
One study of 62,354 patients recently published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal found that one in five were diagnosed with a mental health disorder within three months of testing positive for the coronavirus. “But what’s the chicken and what’s the egg?” Lancaster asks. “It could be that there are people with leakier brains to start with, who when they get **Covid**-19 are more likely to have viral entry into their brain.”
Neuro-inflammation might also help explain some of the weirder long-**Covid** symptoms reported by parents of children who have had **Covid**-19, like something called Alice in Wonderland syndrome, an alteration of visual perception where objects or body part sizes are perceived incorrectly. Simpson says her son’s vision regularly goes blurry, and he describes people’s heads “going small.”
Gretchen Drown of Portland, Maine, also says that her 15-year old son, who got **Covid**-19 in March, describes “things looking weird,” and that during these episodes, his pupils get strangely dilated. Drown’s son also now has headaches and extreme fatigue, which worsen after he overexerts himself, making it hard to keep up with school.
Damaging the blood-brain barrier also hurts its ability to make cerebrospinal fluid, which is important for providing nutrients to the brain and removing its normal waste. Lancaster calls the cerebrospinal fluid the plumbing system of the brain. “Imagine your house with all your toilets clogged — a similar thing can happen in the brain,” she says.
Much of this fluid cycling normally occurs during sleep, so Lancaster suggests that Alice in Wonderland syndrome — and possibly other common neurological symptoms in long **Covid**, like extreme fatigue and insomnia — might be related to the virus compromising the body’s ability to generate and manage this fluid.
Children and long **Covid**
As the pandemic began, it appeared most children had mild cases of **Covid**-19. But while clinicians have not been tracking long **Covid** in children, it’s clear from the many parents Vox interviewed that children of any age can and do experience persistent symptoms that can completely alter their ability to function.
That no one seems to be paying attention to pediatric long-**Covid** cases is a source of extreme frustration. Multiple parents reported that during their efforts to get their children care, medical providers accused them of Munchausen syndrome, a psychological disorder where someone pretends to be ill.
Sammie says when a nurse suggested it to her, “I literally think if I hadn’t had a mask on, my jaw would have fallen off. I felt so broken — it makes me feel emotional talking about it now.” Since then, she’s complained to the clinic and actually gotten a letter of apology. But her experience demonstrates the hurdles parents face in getting their children the care they need. “I think there are a lot more children who are ill, and who no one is connecting the dots for,” Sammie says.
While it’s hard to quantify something no one is tracking, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests about 11 percent of US **Covid**-19 cases are children, with over 1,460,905 children contracting the virus as of December 3. It’s easier to count more acute **Covid**-19 consequences, like MIS-C: In one study of kids under 18 with MIS-C, 14.8 percent exhibited new neurological symptoms like headaches, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. The youngest child with persistent symptoms Vox found was 18 months; the oldest was 15.
While some of the symptoms parents have reported in children are similar to adult long-**Covid** cases — headaches, extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating or forming new memories, anxiety, depression, tachycardia, dysautonomia, lingering or recurrent fevers — others differ. Some parents in the long-**Covid** kids online group Sammie formed, for example, have been reporting frequent nosebleeds.
Some of the parents, like Simpson, are themselves suffering from long **Covid**. “In many families who have kids with long **Covid**, there’s a mother or father who has it as well. People should be tripping over themselves to research if this is genetic,” she says.
But in the meantime, for parents like Sammie, Simpson, Meredith, and Drown, there are few resources to help their children recover. Though it hasn’t been easy, Sammie hasn’t given up trying to get her daughter into more specialized care. “If I don’t advocate for my child, who the hell is going to do it?” she asks.
Parents worry about how their children’s lives might be impacted by the long-term effects of this disease. For adult patients, too, the repercussions are potentially huge.
One doctor, whose family asked that her name be withheld for privacy reasons, first got sick this spring. She eventually despaired of finding treatment for her long-**Covid** symptoms. She recently drove to New York — because she wanted to be near the best researchers she knew of — before ending her life. She donated her body to science.
For those who survive, like Brown, the questions are pervasive. “How will this affect me when I want to have a baby?” Brown asks. “What is next? We have no idea. No one can tell me anything specific.” She’s frustrated that friends her age still assume that if they get infected, they’ll recover.
“You might be okay, but you might not,” Brown says. She says she’s angry about how the pandemic has been measured in deaths rather than in lives disrupted. “The disparities are shocking. And more will be lost if we don’t make adjustments.”

2020-05-05 10:50:00,vox.com,6.7283826,Lean Left,"Covid-19 is way, way worse than the flu","Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, the question on many people’s minds was: “Isn’t this disease like the flu?” **Covid**-19 is a respiratory disease with some symptoms that resemble those of the seasonal flu, like fever and cough.
New evidence in the form of blood tests conducted in New York show that **Covid**-19 is at least as deadly as scientists have suspected for some weeks now. This is not like the seasonal flu. It is worse.
This is not to downplay the flu, which is an annual blight we could be even more proactive about fighting (annual flu shots are important!). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that between 12,000 and 61,000 people die of the flu every year. (President Trump has routinely sought to downplay the **Covid**-19 pandemic — particularly early on — by making comparisons to the flu.)
But also, keep in mind: That’s in a given year. **Covid**-19 hasn’t been around a year — or even half a year. Before January, this virus was not known to science, at all.
Yet the virus is already responsible for around 69,000 recorded deaths in the US as of May 5; and this is almost certainly an undercount. Around 2,000 people are still dying of **Covid**-19 every day in the United States alone.
While there is still a lot of uncertainty about the coronavirus and how it will play out, based on what we know so far, this is a threat to take extremely seriously.
Reasons why **Covid**-19 is worse than the flu
While the exact global death rate is not yet clear, the evidence so far shows that the disease kills a larger proportion of people than the flu (and it’s particularly lethal for people older than 80).
This can be confusing because there are two figures used to describe how deadly a virus is. There’s the case fatality rate — the rate of deaths resulting from a given number of confirmed cases. And there’s the infection fatality ratio — the rate of deaths per infection, including asymptomatic infections and mild cases.
April data from New York suggests that the infection fatality rate of **Covid**-19 was between 0.5 and 0.8 percent, which matches international estimates. Estimates of case fatality rates are higher and vary quite a bit country by country.
That infection fatality rate for **Covid**-19 is much, much higher than the flu, which has an infection fatality rate of around 0.02 to 0.05 percent, according to infectious disease epidemiologist Adam Kucharski on Twitter. This means **Covid**-19 may be more than 10 times more deadly than the flu.
So if we're calculating risk infection is fatal, we need to compare total flu infections - potentially 1/3 of population - with annual deaths. As rough estimate, this suggests 0.02-0.05% of flu infections are fatal, i.e. 10x lower than **COVID** (Data: https://t.co/MA6BixjgQW) 5/ — Adam Kucharski (@AdamJKucharski) March 27, 2020
Comparing **Covid**-19 deaths to flu deaths may be misleading in another way, Harvard physician Jeremy Samuel Faust writes in Scientific American. The CDC flu death figures “are estimates that the CDC produces by multiplying the number of flu death counts reported by various coefficients produced through complicated algorithms,” Faust writes. The data we have on **Covid**-19 deaths are of recorded deaths. It’s possible that the CDC is overestimating the mortality of the flu. So comparing the two isn’t apples to apples.
But comparing recorded flu deaths to recorded **Covid**-19 deaths is also telling. Faust writes:
If we compare, for instance, the number of people who died in the United States from **COVID**-19 in the second full week of April to the number of people who died from influenza during the worst week of the past seven flu seasons (as reported to the CDC), we find that the novel coronavirus killed between 9.5 and 44 times more people than seasonal flu. In other words, the coronavirus is not anything like the flu: It is much, much worse.
The death rate isn’t the only reason why **Covid**-19 is worse. It also has a higher potential to overwhelm America’s health care system and threaten people with other illnesses or underlying conditions. Currently, there is no vaccine for the virus, nor any approved therapeutics to slow the course of its toll on the human body.
Biologically, it behaves differently than the flu. It takes one to 14 days for people with **Covid**-19 to develop symptoms (five days is the median). For the flu, it’s around two days. That potentially gives people more time to spread the illness asymptomatically before they know they are sick.
It’s estimated that 25 percent or more of **Covid**-19 infections may be asymptomatic. That’s greater than for the flu; about 16 percent of flu cases are asymptomatic, a recent Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy report notes. “Thus, while both viruses can lead to asymptomatic infections, the asymptomatic fraction appears to be somewhat higher for **COVID**-19 than for influenza,” the report says.
That makes this virus sneaky. The report also says there’s evidence to suggest that presymptomatic transmission (transmission before someone feels sick) is more common with **Covid**-19 than the flu.
Some flu seasons are worse than others — but facilities can anticipate flu cases and prepare for them. Many hospitals, as Vox’s Dylan Scott has reported, have struggled in their preparations for **Covid**-19.
Several months ago, the coronavirus was believed to have made the leap from animals to humans. As far as scientists know, no human immune system had seen it before November, so there was no natural immunity to it. That means **Covid**-19 is more contagious than the flu — about twice as contagious, perhaps more; the numbers are still being worked out.
When a flu pandemic came through in the past, “there was there was already a lot of pre existing immunity to the virus,” Sarah Cobey, a University of Chicago infectious disease modeler, says. It’s unclear if there’s any preexisting immunity for **Covid**-19 based on exposure to other coronavirus strains.
The threat of it causing more outbreaks that overwhelm health systems around the world is serious. It’s bad enough to roil stock markets, put people out of work, and cause a recession. It could potentially kill millions, both in the US and abroad, in the next year or two.
It’s also possible that **Covid**-19 will become endemic — meaning a disease that regularly attacks humans and will not go away until there’s a treatment or a vaccine.
Again: Yes, flu variants are estimated to kill tens of thousands of people a year in the US. But we still have the flu. And now we have a new burden on top of that — making everything worse."
2020-09-09 10:30:48,thefederalist.com,6.723592,Lean Right,Lockdowns Are Now A Political Issue For Every Official On The Ballot,"Americans on either side of the debates surrounding **COVID**-19 need to hear how office-seekers would respond to the next **COVID**-19 spike, pandemic, or flu.
“I would shut it down,” Vice President Joe Biden recently promised when asked how he would respond to **COVID**-19 flareups, “I would listen to the scientists.” After experimenting with that option in March and April, President Donald Trump has vowed, “We won’t be closing the country again.”
The Trump-Biden divergence on this issue provides a clarifying distinction as Americans head into the home stretch of the 2020 presidential election. But what about gubernatorial, mayoral, and school-board elections, and what about elections beyond 2020? Knowing where a candidate stands on this issue — which affects every American — will be important for years to come.
Americans on either side of the **COVID**-19 divide — those who believe they have to take individual responsibility, who recall that America didn’t shut down during the pandemics of 1957 or 1968, who believe life must go on to preserve individual liberty, as well as those who believe in promoting social responsibility, who view **COVID**-19 as more deadly than past pandemics, and who believe life must change to preserve public health — would benefit from knowing how politicians would respond to the next **COVID**-19 spike, pandemic, or flu.
The Likelihood of Another Chinese Virus
Through either China’s incompetence or intention, another virus of the sort of **COVID**-19 will likely be unleashed upon the world in the future. H5N1, SARS, and **COVID**-19 are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths globally, and each began in China.
We now know Xi Jinping’s regime lied about the human-to-human transmission of **COVID**-19, allowed thousands to leave Wuhan for destinations around the world, ordered scientists not to share findings of coronavirus-genome sequencing, and carried out a premeditated plan to hoard 2.5 billion pieces of medical gear as the virus swept the globe.
It can no longer be hidden: China is an ends-justify-the-means regime that has disdain for human life and norms of behavior. It’s a place physicians are arrested and left to die for trying to live up to the oaths of medicine. It’s where Christians are sent to reeducation camps, Buddhist temples are bulldozed, Uighur Muslim men are herded into concentration camps, Uighur women are forcibly sterilized, and Uighur babies are forcibly aborted.
As dissident leader Xu Zhangrun observes, “A polity that is blatantly incapable of treating its own people properly can hardly be expected to treat the rest of the world well.”
The Unintended Consequences of Lockdowns
In truth, the lockdown way of life is an enemy of life and living. The lockdowns effectively prevented hundreds of millions of Americans from gathering for worship, cost tens of millions their jobs, and permanently shuttered more than 100,000 U.S. businesses. The isolation, job loss, and depression triggered by the lockdowns will lead to 75,000 deaths from drug abuse, alcoholism, and suicide. Not even the more than $3.2 trillion in deficit spending since March can cure despair.
Millions of surgeries have been delayed. Heart-attack death rates have spiked not because of **COVID**-19, but because the fear of **COVID**-19 kept patients away from getting the care they urgently needed. Researchers project 10,000 excess cancer deaths in America as a result of delayed screening caused by lockdowns. Half of cancer patients have missed chemotherapy treatments, transplants are down almost 85 percent, and emergency stroke evaluations are down 40 percent.
Brookings concludes, “The **COVID**-19 episode will likely lead to a large, lasting baby bust … a drop of perhaps 300,000 to 500,000 births in the U.S” next year. This is not a function of deaths among women of childbearing age, but of despair and uncertainty.
Domestic violence and childhood malnutrition have surged during the lockdown. Some 212,500 cases of child abuse have gone unreported due to the lockdown — a consequence of kids not being in school, where abuse is often first detected. Indeed, we may never be able to quantify the costs of a year without classroom instruction, which is why the American Academy of Pediatrics calls for reopening schools.
Data — not wildly inaccurate computer models — tell us why doctors say it’s safe to return to classroom instruction: **COVID**-19 poses an almost imperceivably small risk to Americans younger than 24, with that age group representing just 0.1 percent of **COVID**-19 deaths. Americans 14 and younger account for 145 **COVID**-19 deaths according to the Centers for Disease Control. Yet governors, mayors, and school boards claim to know more than pediatricians about child wellbeing.
Taking a Pledge
Rather than closing the schools, quarantining the healthy, and idling the economy, Sunetra Gupta, an Oxford University professor of infectious-disease epidemiology, has argued for months that we must find “a way of living with this virus.” Both history and science tell us that the lockdown way of life isn’t the answer to pandemics.
Yes, **COVID**-19’s infection-mortality rate was initially thought to be 3.4 percent, which understandably terrified policymakers. But as we learned more about the virus, the actual infection-mortality rate rapidly emerged in the data. As the Hoover Institution’s Scott Atlas explained in congressional testimony The virus kills between 0.1 percent and 0.4 percent of those infected. The seasonal flu, by comparison, kills about 0.1 percent of the infected.
Those who argue government reaction to **COVID**-19 is at best ahistorical and, at worst, draconian, must concede that **COVID**-19 could be more deadly than the flu. At the same time, those who support federal, state, and local government responses to **COVID**-19 must concede that **COVID**-19 is definitively not another Spanish Flu. It’s not even another H2N2 pandemic, which killed 0.67 percent of those infected in 1957.
In raw numbers, **COVID**-19 has claimed more than 190,000 Americans out of a population of 331.3 million. That sounds like a high death toll until we compare it to that 1957 pandemic, which claimed 116,000 Americans out of a population of 171 million. Even with the expansive accounting methods used by New York, Colorado, Washington, and key federal officials (who argue that dying with **COVID**-19 is the same as dying from **COVID**-19), this disease is less deadly than the 1957 flu.
According to Anthony Fauci, “The overall clinical consequences of **COVID**-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1 percent) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968).”
The numbers and Fauci’s assessment force us to ponder the policy reactions triggered by **COVID**-19. We didn’t close churches, schools, or businesses, cancel sports seasons, or amass staggering debt in response to pandemics in 1957 or 1968. But we did in 2020. Is this the new-normal response to viruses?
Candidates at every level of government should follow the lead of President Trump and Vice President Biden and go on the record answering that question. Lockdown opponents could call it the “Liberty from Lockdowns Pledge.” Lockdown supporters could call it the “Pandemic Protection Pledge.”
Similar pledges help Americans know where policymakers stand on taxation, abortion, fossil fuels, the Second Amendment, Social Security, campaign finance. We need a similar pledge for something with the potential to have such a monumental effect on our society.
There are Democratic and Republican officials who support the lockdown way of life, and there are Democratic and Republican officials who oppose the lockdown way of life. This isn’t a political issue so much as a philosophical one. These pledges would serve as a way for us to educate ourselves about the philosophical bent of those vying to run our school boards, cities, states, and country — and then, to vote accordingly."
2020-07-29 08:20:00,vox.com,6.717743,Lean Left,"The odd, growing list of Covid-19 symptoms, explained","More than six months into the coronavirus pandemic, the list of symptoms caused by the disease **Covid**-19 is still getting longer.
Beyond the most common symptoms of cough, fever, and shortness of breath, patients have reported other troubling maladies: vomiting, rashes, a loss of taste and smell, muscle aches, and even toe lesions dubbed “**Covid** toes.”
With more than 16.5 million confirmed cases worldwide, researchers are getting a better handle on the early warning signs of infection and how it plays out throughout the body during the course of the disease. These new insights into symptoms are shedding light on what the virus does to the body, when patients are at highest risk of infecting others, and potential ways to treat it.
And with a larger pool of people recovered from the infection, long-term effects of the illness are also emerging, including symptoms that won’t go away. “**Covid**-19 can result in prolonged illness, even among young adults without underlying chronic medical conditions,” according to a July 24 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. The same report found that one in three symptomatic adults who were surveyed still weren’t fully recovered between two and three weeks after testing positive for **Covid**-19.
“It is such a unique infection in its ability to cause so much damage in so many different ways, in so many different organ systems,” said Andrew Chan, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-founder of the **COVID** Symptom Study app. “It’s been very humbling for us as physicians and as a scientific community.”
The growing of list of **Covid**-19 symptoms, short- and long-term, is yet another example of our evolving understanding of the disease, from how it spreads to how long immunity may last to what treatments may be effective. There is likely much more still to learn about **Covid**-19 symptoms as scientists gather more data, but here is what they’ve uncovered in recent months about the signs of the disease, how clusters of symptoms can signal more severe complications, and the collateral damage throughout the body.
What the most recent evidence says about **Covid**-19 symptoms
A recent survey from the CDC identified several symptoms common across the infected. “Among 164 symptomatic **COVID**-19 patients, nearly all experienced fever, cough, or shortness of breath,” according to a July 17 report from the agency. “However, a wide variety of other symptoms were also reported; chills, myalgia [muscle soreness], headache, fatigue, and the presence of at least one [gastrointestinal] symptom (most commonly diarrhea) were each reported by >50% of patients.”
This aligns with earlier surveys, like one from the World Health Organization back in February, which found conventional symptoms of a respiratory infection were common in **Covid**-19 patients in China. The most common signs among more than 55,000 confirmed cases were: fever (87.9 percent of confirmed cases), dry cough (67.7 percent), fatigue (38.1 percent), sputum [phlegm] production (33.4 percent), shortness of breath (18.6 percent), sore throat (13.9 percent), and headache (13.6 percent).
But surveys like this from earlier in the pandemic had a harder time detecting milder symptoms. Most of the reports were among patients who were hospitalized or had received medical treatment for **Covid**-19, meaning they were already experiencing a severe course of the disease. People with less alarming signs were often not detected.
To suss out some of the more subtle symptoms of **Covid**-19, Harvard’s Chan and his team developed the **COVID** Symptom Study app, a mobile app that lets users self-report symptoms daily, whether or not they feel sick or have had a test for **Covid**-19.
The app has more than 4 million users in the US alone. By tracking symptoms across large groups of people, Chan and his collaborators have been able to identify emerging **Covid**-19 hot spots and detect new signals of the virus.
“The symptom that appears to be the strongest predictor of **Covid** continues to be a loss of taste or smell, and that’s been a thing that’s been continually shown in the data we’re getting in the app,” said Chan. “In particular, the fact that that symptom is relatively uncommon in other viral syndromes, certainly uncommon in seasonal allergies, makes it useful.”
The CDC added a loss of taste and smell to its symptoms guidelines in April, and Chan published his findings in a May 11 paper in the journal Nature Medicine.
Since it’s a more unique symptom to **Covid**-19 than fever, Chan suggested that screening for taste and smell could serve as a stopgap way to detect infections, especially in places with testing shortages and backlogs. “You can imagine that tests that are able to pick up a loss of smell might be easier to deploy at a large scale, might be more cost-efficient, and could really address some of the shortcomings of our present efforts with respect to testing,” Chan said.
Even more recently, the app has started to pick up signs that skin rashes — raised skin bumps, itchy and red skin, and inflammation on fingers and toes — could be a harbinger of **Covid**-19 for some. In a recent preprint paper, a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed, researchers conducted a subsequent survey based on these hints. They found that of 11,546 respondents, 17 percent of people with a confirmed **Covid**-19 infection reported that a rash was their first symptom. Of the patients reporting rashes, 21 percent said that rashes were their only symptom.
“Even though skin rashes may not be that common in **Covid**, the fact that they do arise, the fact that they may be a more specific sign, highlight how important it is to really assess their prevalence and how predictive they are,” Chan said.
Other preliminary studies, like one of 204 patients in China, found that more than half of **Covid**-19 patients experienced gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Some **Covid**-19 patients reported runny noses. Others experienced feelings of discomfort and malaise. In children, **Covid**-19 — even previously undetected cases — can spur an inflammatory condition similar to one known as Kawasaki disease. Several older people infected with the virus exhibited neurological maladies like confusion and seizures. Patients of all ages have also experienced abnormal blood clotting, causing strokes in otherwise healthy people.
Related How people without symptoms can still spread the coronavirus
In short, there are a lot of different ways that **Covid**-19 can show up in a person. But at the same time, an unknown number of people may be infected without showing any outward signs. Studies have found the share of asymptomatic patients can comprise anywhere from 18 percent to 40 percent of infected people.
The precise fraction of people infected with **Covid**-19 who are completely asymptomatic is still being studied, but it’s clear that there are infected people who can spread the virus without coughing or feeling feverish. Even among patients who do show symptoms, some studies have found that they are most infectious just before they start feeling off, rather than when they suffer their worst fevers, rashes, or breathing problems.
That means it’s critical to identify infected people as early as possible and have them isolate from others in order to control the pandemic. And while symptoms can serve as a diagnostic tool in a pinch, robust testing is still needed to identify hidden infections to contain the spread of **Covid**-19.
Clusters of **Covid**-19 symptoms can predict more severe complications from the infection
Many **Covid**-19 symptoms overlap with those of other illnesses, so the patterns of how they emerge together can be a more useful warning sign for the virus than any one symptom alone. In another preprint paper using data from the tracking app, researchers identified six distinct clusters of symptoms for **Covid**-19.
These groupings were associated with varying degrees of severity of illness. For instance, among patients experiencing one cluster of symptoms — headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, and muscle pain — 9.9 percent of them ended up needing supplemental oxygen or ventilation.
Meanwhile, patients who experienced the above symptoms, but in addition experienced shortness of breath, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, faced far more severe outcomes. About half of the patients with this second symptom cluster were hospitalized, and 19.8 percent of them required breathing support.
So it’s not just one symptom but several together that are associated with how the disease progresses. These clusters often emerge in the first five days of the illness, but people who need help breathing often arrive nearly two weeks after they first start showing signs. That means symptom clusters could serve as an early alert, helping health providers anticipate the likelihood of a patient needing to be hospitalized and perhaps prompt earlier treatment.
Being able to identify **Covid**-19 symptoms matters for preventing spread
When testing is slow or lacking, a cough and fever are often enough for a person to get diagnosed as a **Covid**-19 patient, with the associated protocols for isolation. And while waiting for a test result, people often have to decide how to isolate from others and take precautions based on what they feel.
After exposure to the virus, it can take two to 14 days for a patient to experience symptoms, if they feel them at all. During that time, these presymptomatic people can spread the virus to other people — especially in the couple of days before they start feeling sick.
Figuring out when key symptoms set in is also important because guidelines for distancing after an infection are often based on when they arise. “For most persons with **COVID**-19 illness, isolation and precautions can generally be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms,” according to new CDC guidance based on new information about how long the virus is active and transmissible (emphasis in the original document).
And as the recent findings about symptom clusters show, a specific group of warning signs can signal that a more severe course of the disease is in store in the coming days.
Some symptoms of **Covid**-19 stem from the immune system’s response
Fever, rashes, and inflammation are often the signs of the immune system’s battle with an infection. But sometimes, the immune system can overreact, causing conditions like cytokine storms where the body overproduces cytokines, signaling molecules that alert cells to an infection. That can cause immune cells to attack otherwise healthy cells, leading to the failure of organs like the liver and kidneys and, eventually, death. Even among survivors, this can cause lasting damage.
Still, despite its complexity as a disease, researchers are learning that **Covid**-19 operates in ways that are distinct from many other infections. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) stemming from **Covid**-19 is a case in point.
ARDS is a condition in some of the most severe **Covid**-19 cases, causing the lungs to flood with fluid, cutting off oxygen supply to the blood. Patients with ARDS often need to be treated with a ventilator and are frequently left with severe organ damage.
Nuala Meyer, a critical care lung doctor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine who studies ARDS, typically treats patients suffering with ARDS as the result of the flu. But, she said, “the patients we were seeing [with **Covid**-19] were quite different.”
With flu patients who have ARDS, doctors expect the very worst cases to be among those with asthma, or those who are immunocompromised. Instead, the worst-faring **Covid**-19 cases were more likely to have heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or obesity. “They generally did not have asthma,” Meyer said. “And some of the patients who were immunocompromised did do really poorly and others did surprisingly well.”
It’s been hard for doctors to predict which **Covid**-19 patients will fare worse, and develop severe complications like ARDS. But recently, a study from Meyer and her colleagues added new evidence to what’s long been a theory: that it’s not the virus that’s causing the symptoms, but the patient’s immune system.
In a study of 125 patients, Meyer and colleagues observed three different “immunotypes” or broad patterns of immune response, which may account for the range in severity of disease. It’s currently not clear what leads someone to one immune response or another, but this work, and other work like it, can lead to the detection of biomarkers that indicate people most likely to experience severe disease. Those who had some of the worst outcomes, and spent the most time on a hospital ventilator, were more likely to have dysregulated immune response, Meyers said.
“The fear is that either too persistent an [immune] activation or too robust an activation might contribute to the organ damage that we see,” she said. In Nature, researchers led by Akiko Iwasaki of Yale have noted that many of the most severe **Covid**-19 symptoms are correlated with an elevated cytokine response, which can lead to damaging inflammation.
The hope is, with a better understanding of the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, doctors could diagnose patients who are most likely to have this severe reaction, and take steps to prevent the worst reaction from occurring. “That’s where we’d certainly like to go,” Meyer said.
Researchers have already found that drugs that suppress the immune system like dexamethasone can save the lives of the most severely ill **Covid**-19 patients. But since it tamps down the immune response, it can cause a milder infection to get worse or leave a patient susceptible to another pathogen. That severely limits how useful it can be as a treatment, but it highlights the importance of tuning the immune system to thwart a disease without going any further.
Understanding the immune response to the virus is also critical to making a vaccine for **Covid**-19, a tool that can ultimately end the pandemic. As knowledge of **Covid**-19 and immunity improves, researchers expect to gain ground both in fighting the illness and preventing it altogether.
**Covid**-19 can have ripple effects throughout the body, but the process is still unclear
While **Covid**-19 is a respiratory infection, it’s become increasingly apparent in recent months that its effects can have cascading consequences throughout the body. Scientists are now piecing together the mechanisms behind these effects in hopes of stopping some of the worst outcomes and to get ahead of long-term problems.
Donald Landry, chair of the department of medicine at Columbia University, co-authored a recent study in the journal Nature Medicine looking at all the ways **Covid**-19 can impair the body beyond the lungs and airways. The list is long: blood clots, irregular heartbeat, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal distress, liver damage, high blood sugar, neurologic illnesses, vision problems, and skin complications.
To understand why, it helps to examine how the virus itself works. SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind **Covid**-19, starts an infection by docking one of its spike proteins with a receptor on a human cell known as ACE2, which is involved in the regulation of blood pressure. So the virus interfering with this mechanism can lead to problems stemming from constricted blood vessels. That interference, plus direct viral damage in blood vessels that have the ACE2 receptor, can cause inflammation and blood clots.
But the virus may be doing something else still unknown that’s causing blood clots. Landry noted that when **Covid**-19 patients were receiving treatments like ECMO and hemodialysis that involved circulating blood outside the body, the tubing transporting blood in and out of the body also clotted.
“The clotting system itself seems to be revved,” Landry said. “It’s not just inflamed blood vessels; it’s a hyper-coagulable state, so it would seem.”
Those blood clots are dangerous because they can easily choke off tiny blood vessels and impede the blood supply to parts of the body — lungs, kidneys, liver. However, the damage to those organs can confusingly manifest in other parts of the body. A failing kidney could mean less fluid is removed from the body, leading more fluid to accumulate in the lungs, worsening the respiratory symptoms of **Covid**-19, according to Landry.
The effects of organ damage can also linger and become permanent, even after the virus is eliminated. If a blood clot blocks a vessel leading to the heart, for example, it can cause the death of a section of heart muscle, a condition known as a myocardial infarction. “You could be surviving the pulmonary part but you could be dying of the cardiac part,” Landry said.
The ACE2 receptors are not just in blood vessels. They can be found in cells in the lungs, so SARS-CoV-2 may be directly causing respiratory symptoms like coughing as it damages those cells. Similarly, heart and kidney cells have this receptor and may be vulnerable to direct attack from the virus, potentially causing some of the observed cardiovascular symptoms.
So there are three potential sources of **Covid**-19 symptoms: the virus, the immune response to it, and the collateral damage from both. However, sorting out what damage is caused by which mechanism remains a challenge.
“That’s an open question as to what extent is it a primary cytotoxic effect from the virus infection, where it actually damages the cells it’s infecting, versus whether it’s damaging blood vessels,” Landry said. “That whole area needs to be investigated.”
By understanding the mechanisms of **Covid**-19, doctors can better anticipate the myriad ways it can present and come up with ways to counter its worst effects. But it will take yet more research to build this foundation.
The symptoms of **Covid**-19 may stick around for a long time
We’re now far enough into the pandemic that millions of people have recovered from **Covid**-19. While many are no longer contagious, some are finding that the illness has lasting effects on their health.
“For many people, the infection is not a self-limited condition,” Chan said. “Sometimes they’re left with longer-term symptoms that could be quite impairing.”
Already, recovered patients have reported ongoing coughing, trouble concentrating, and muscle weakness. Doctors have also found lesions on the hearts, lungs, and brains of **Covid**-19 patients that can take a long time to heal and may be permanent in some cases.
“Patients who have had terrible pneumonias or ARDS with **Covid**-19, are beginning to present now with syndromes of pulmonary fibrosis,” said Landry. “And this is really a grave lesion that can progress to end stage, requiring lung transplantation.”
Meanwhile, patients with brain damage can suffer lasting speech and mobility issues. **Covid**-19 survivors with heart damage can have persistent arrhythmias that can make it hard for them to conduct basic tasks. Diminished functions of organs like kidneys could progress and contribute to future health problems.
“There may be many more patients on hemodialysis in the future as a result of the severe damage they suffered to their kidney during the acute **Covid**-19 [pandemic],” Landry said.
And it’s not just people who fell severely ill who can suffer residual impacts. Even people who had a less severe course of the disease have reported long-lasting symptoms.
Taken together, the early findings about the long-term impacts of **Covid**-19 show that the world will likely be seeing signs of the illness for years to come — even if the virus were to vanish tomorrow. And in the coming months, even more symptoms and manifestations of the disease may yet emerge."
2020-05-20 10:43:19,newsmax.com,6.7175994,Right,Obesity Increases Odds of Lung Clots in COVID-19 Patients,"Obesity makes **COVID**-19 worse and may lead to deadly blood clots in the lungs, a new study finds.
The researchers said that obese patients with **COVID**-19 may have nearly three times the risk of developing what is known as a pulmonary embolism.
""Clinicians can utilize our findings to aid in determining which patients should have evaluation for pulmonary embolism with pulmonary CT angiography, as the symptoms for **COVID**-19 and pulmonary embolism overlap,"" said lead researcher Dr. Neo Poyiadi, from the department of diagnostic radiology at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.
""Early detection of pulmonary embolism can allow prompt treatment with anticoagulation and minimize clinical problems,"" he said.
Hospitalized obese patients with **COVID**-19 should be evaluated for increases in clotting indicated by a rising D-dimer — a blood test for clotting.
According to the study, 22% of 328 patients suffering from **COVID**-19 who had a CT scan angiography had a pulmonary embolism.
Researchers also found that patients taking statins to lower cholesterol before coming down with **COVID**-19 were less likely to have a pulmonary embolism.
""Further studies are needed to determine if statins have a protective effect against pulmonary embolism in **COVID**-19 patients,"" Poyiadi said.
Poyiadi added that a recent study suggests that **COVID**-19 patients should be placed on blood thinners to prevent clotting.
Obesity may make **COVID**-19 worse because it's associated with an increase in inflammation. Inflammation also increases the risk of clotting.
The report was published online May 14 in the journal Radiology.
Dr. Marc Siegel is a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. He said, ""This study underscores a point that's becoming more widely known about **COVID**-19 — that obesity leads to an inflammatory cascade. We know that inflammatory chemicals increase with obesity. That's the suspected mechanism of why obese patients are more at risk for complications.""
Inflammation can lead to blood clots, although that's not been proven, he noted.
""The complications of **COVID**-19 that we've been seeing are inflammation and a cytokine storm, which causes inflammation in the arteries and blood clots throughout the body — and obesity is a culprit in high-risk patients,"" Siegel said.
""To say that's why we're seeing more pulmonary embolism in obese patients is plausible. It's early small numbers, but it's a very important finding and it's not surprising,"" he said.
What is surprising is it looks like using statins might be helpful. Statins are anti-inflammatories, Siegel noted.
But whether statins are protective is something that would have to be carefully studied, he said. There's no clear-cut reason to start obese patients on statins if they weren't already taking them when they were admitted to the hospital, he added.
Obese patients with **COVID**-19 need the same care as other patients, Siegel said. That includes anticoagulation. Many of the complications of **COVID**-19 seem to be caused by clotting, and starting patients on blood thinners may become a standard treatment.
""We're already starting to look at preventative anticoagulation,"" he said. ""It's already something we're highly aware of, but this study adds evidence to a direct correlation between obesity and blood clots, that's what's new here."""

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released information which revealed that the vast majority of **COVID**-19 deaths were the result of underlying health conditions, called comorbidities.
President Trump tweeted out this information, which is directly stated on the CDC website, but Twitter took down the tweet, saying that it was false information.
According to CBS, Trump's retweet said that ""the CDC 'quietly updated the **Covid** number; to show a small fraction of all deaths — 6% — from the coronavirus were 'actually' a result of **COVID**-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The vast majority of deaths, the post claimed, were because of 'other serious illnesses.'""
Twitter took down the tweet, saying that is is ""no longer available because it violated the Twitter Rules.""
The CDC reported: ""Table 3 shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (**COVID**-19). For 6 [percent] of the deaths, **COVID**-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to **COVID**-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death. The number of deaths with each condition or cause is shown for all deaths and by age groups.""
This information was coupled with a graph that showed **COVID**-related deaths by age. The report also mentioned that of the 161,392 **COVID**-related deaths, a staggering 68,004 of them had influenza or pneumonia, and 54,803 suffered from respiratory failure.
Of the over 180,000 deaths attributed to **COVID**-19, six percent, or 9,683, were recorded on death certificates as having coronavirus as the sole cause of death. This was reported by the CDC on their website.
The United States has seen 6.1 million cased of **COVID**-19, and performs about a quarter million tests for every million people. To date, 187,248 deaths have been attributed to the virus, and there have been nearly 3.5 million recoveries."
