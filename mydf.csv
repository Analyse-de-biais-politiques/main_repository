2020-05-26 20:55:08,theblaze.com,6.9010367,Right,Here are the 10 states where the share of COVID deaths coming from nursing homes are the highest,"We've all heard about the disproportionate share of **COVID**-19 deaths happening in America's nursing homes.
A recently reported study from the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity showed that while only 0.6% of Americans live in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, that population makes up more than 42% of the nation's **COVID**-19 deaths.
The topic has been used to bludgeon some elected leadership — especially New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. One of the biggest attacks on Cuomo has been his role in some 5,000 deaths in his state's nursing homes following his March 25 executive order forcing nursing homes to accept coronavirus-positive people.
But did you know New York's reported nursing home deaths as a share of the state's **COVID**-19 deaths are the lowest in the nation? The Empire State has seen 13.8% of its **COVID**-19 deaths in nursing homes. (However, some analysts have pointed out that New York's reporting might not be accurate.) The second-lowest rate so far is Nevada's 23.9%, according to a newly updated FREOPP report.
In fact, because New York is such an outlier considering its high share of overall coronavirus cases and deaths as well as its data reporting methods, if the state's data is removed from the calculations, the nursing home share of **COVID**-19 deaths nationwide jumps to 52%.
What's happening in the states?
So, which states are seeing the highest share of **COVID**-19 deaths in their long-term care facilities?
FREOPP looked at state-by-state data, and found that, among states that break out deaths by residential categories, about 60% of them have seen more than half of their **COVID**-19 fatalities come from nursing homes.
Only two states — the aforementioned New York and Nevada — have seen less than a third of their **COVID**-19 deaths come from nursing homes.
Below are the states where nursing home deaths are the greatest share of **COVID**-19 deaths.
No word yet on how the leadership in these states will be held accountable.
Top 10 states where the share of **COVID**-19 deaths coming from nursing homes are the highest
No. 1: MINNESOTA — 81.4% of all **COVID**-19 deaths
No. 2: RHODE ISLAND — 77% of all **COVID**-19 deaths
No. 3: OHIO — 70% of all **COVID**-19 deaths
No. 4: NEW HAMPSHIRE — 69.8% of all **COVID**-19 deaths
No. 5: PENNSYLVANIA — 69.2% of all **COVID**-19 deaths
No. 6: DELAWARE — 64.2% of all **COVID**-19 deaths

2020-05-26 19:07:47,thefederalist.com,6.853791,Lean Right,Gov. Whitmer's Nursing Home Response In Michigan Mimics Andrew Cuomo's Mistakes In New York,"Michigan’s Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced a new executive order directing nursing homes on how to care for **COVID**-19 patients. The orders looks eerily similar to New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s advisory requiring elderly people with positive **COVID**-19 diagnosis be readmitted to nursing facilities.
Whitmer’s own Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) Director Robert Gordon sounded the alarm on the new executive order and the inaccurate measurements of **COVID**-19 related deaths emerging from Michigan nursing homes.
During a Michigan Senate Oversight Committee hearing, Gordon said he does not believe Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer when she reported 687 nursing home deaths via **COVID**-19. Gordon claims the number is an “undercount.”
“That number is **COVID** related deaths that have been reported, I do not stand behind that number as an accurate and full accounting of **COVID** related nursing home deaths and I wouldn’t want us to present it that way… I think that number is probably, in fact, I’m confident that number is an undercount,” Gordon said.
Across the United States, nursing homes and assisted living facilities account for 42 percent of **COVID**-19 deaths. It is impossible to tell the percentage of nursing home deaths in the state as Michigan is among eight other states that do not record deaths by residential category, according to the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity (FREOPP).
Fortunately, one state with near-identical policies gives us insight into the disaster coming for Michigan’s most vulnerable communities.
On March 25, New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a controversial advisory demanding hospitals discharge elderly patients with **COVID**-19 back to nursing homes. The advisory was built to combat alleged “discrimination” of those with **COVID**-19.
“No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to [nursing homes] solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of **COVID**-19,” the advisory reads.
Whitmer mimicked New York’s advisory to combat alleged discrimination and insisted a long-term care facility cannot prohibit readmission of a resident based on **COVID**-19 testing results.
“A long-term care facility must not prohibit admission or readmission of a resident based on **COVID**-19 testing requirements or results in a manner that is inconsistent with this order,” Whitmer’s new executive order reads.
In her new executive order, Whitmer also instituted the creation of “regional hubs” for **COVID**-19 affected residents. These are designated nursing homes that will act as a conglomerate for other nursing homes that do not provide a designated **COVID**-19 unit. Some nursing homes will rid their facilities of **COVID**-19 patients, while others create a full-blown hub.
“If the long-term care facility does not have a dedicated unit, it must attempt to transfer the **COVID**-19-affected resident to a regional hub, an alternate care facility with physical and operational capacity to care for the resident, or an available swing bed at a hospital,” the order reads.
The Traverse City Record-Eagle reported state officials do not see fit to require extra inspections of nursing homes that sign on to receive **COVID**-19 patients as regional hub facilities. The governor’s order means care facilities with no **COVID**-19 patients will be treated the same as care facilities with the entire region’s conglomerate of elderly **COVID**-19 patients.
**COVID**-19 has plagued nursing homes and elderly care facilities disproportionately. The virus has killed upwards of 10,500 residents in facilities nationwide or approximately one-fifth of the U.S. coronavirus death toll. Cuomo’s and Whitmer’s decisions to force nursing homes to care for **COVID**-19 patients are to blame for the increasing numbers and atrocity among the nation’s most vulnerable population."
2020-04-15 15:04:18,cnbc.com,6.812373,Center,New York City struggles to get accurate fatality count as more people die at home,"New York City is struggling to get an accurate count of the number of **Covid**-19 fatalities as more people die at home and some likely coronavirus deaths are attributed to heart attacks and other causes, Mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledged Wednesday.
On Tuesday, New York City officials said they would begin counting ""probable"" **Covid**-19 deaths, which are people ""who had no known positive laboratory test,"" but are believed to have died due to **Covid**-19. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene estimates that there have been 3,778 probable **Covid**-19 deaths since March 11 that weren't previously counted in the city's official tally. There have been 6,589 confirmed **Covid**-19 deaths in New York City so far.
""I want the whole truth out. Wherever the facts take us, I want the whole truth out,"" de Blasio said Wednesday at a news briefing. ""Absolutely, I believe there are more people who died because of **Covid**-19, in one way or another, because of something that happened to them related to **Covid**-19.""
New York City has had to prioritize coronavirus testing due to a scarcity of test kits and the supplies needed to analyze them, de Blasio has previously said. As a result, testing has gone largely to those who are already in the hospital and first responders, according to de Blasio. People exhibiting symptoms consistent with **Covid**-19 but who remain at home may not be tested and thus excluded from the official count of cases — even if they die.
De blasio has repeatedly emphasized that the city is operating on a ""wartime dynamic,"" meaning that officials are making decisions rapidly as the situation evolves. He said the decision to report probable **Covid**-19 deaths was made to be more transparent with the public about the magnitude of the outbreak.
NYC Health Department Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said most people who have died from **Covid**-19 were diagnosed in hospitals. However, the city has seen significantly more people dying at home than usual, Barbot said.
Barbot said the city has compared ""the number of deaths during that same time period in the previous year and what we find is that there are roughly 3,000 deaths above what would have been anticipated.""
In the first five days of April, the number of people who died in their homes or on the street in New York City was more than eight times the deaths recorded during the same period last year, The New York Times reported, citing the New York Fire Department.
The official count could also be missing patients who suffered from other illnesses. Barbot called for more research into how **Covid**-19 interacts with other illnesses. For example, she said some people who have died after having a heart attack but also exhibited **Covid**-19 symptoms might be missed in the official tally.
""Are there potentially cases where someone registered a death as a heart attack because the person hadn't yet developed symptoms of **Covid**-19 and truly should have been categorized as a **Covid** probable?"" she said. ""I don't know if we'll ever be able to answer that question fully, but I think it's something that still needs to be looked into further.""
Dr. J Mocco, Director of Mt. Sinai's Cerebrovascular Center in New York City, which handles stroke patients, told CNBC that there's an emerging base of evidence to indicate that **Covid**-19 exacerbates strokes and potentially other medical conditions.
""We're seeing more strokes than before and they are a large percent **Covid** positive,"" he said. ""We had five patients over a two-week time period who were 49 years old or younger, which is not standard, who had no other risk factors except for being **Covid** positive.""
Mocco said it's possible that people are suffering strokes and staying at home out of fear of catching **Covid**-19 in the hospital, but they might already have the disease and it could even be a cause of the stroke. Such patients would not be tested for **Covid**-19 and thus could be missed by the city's official tally. Mocco's team at Mt. Sinai, in the epicenter of the U.S. **Covid**-19 outbreak, continues to research how the respiratory disease interacts with other illnesses.

2020-10-25 15:30:00,vox.com,6.771537,Lean Left,Trump’s pandemic rallies spread coronavirus infection and misinformation,"With the pandemic getting worse, not better, President Donald Trump tried to turn reality on its head during a series of rallies on Saturday in North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin.
“We’re rounding the turn. Our numbers are incredible,” Trump claimed in Lumberton, North Carolina, before blasting the media for its alleged fear-mongering.
But the US is not rounding a turn for the better. Friday and Saturday saw new daily coronavirus infections in the US surge past 80,000 for the first time ever. And it’s not just cases — hospitalizations are up more than 33 percent over the last month, and the seven-day average of deaths is now back above 800.
“That’s all I hear about now. Turn on television, ‘**Covid**, **Covid**, **Covid** **Covid** **Covid**.’ A plane goes down, 500 people dead, they don’t talk about it. ‘**Covid** **Covid** **Covid** **Covid**.’ By the way, on November 4, you won’t hear about it anymore,” Trump said. (In case it’s not clear, the plane crash he referred to was made up.)
""That's all I hear about now. Turn on TV, '**Covid**, **Covid**, **Covid** **Covid** **Covid**.' A plane goes down, 500 people dead, they don't talk about it. '**Covid** **Covid** **Covid** **Covid**.' By the way, on November 4th, you won't hear about it anymore ... 'please don't go and vote, **Covid**!'"" -- Trump pic.twitter.com/1bh7x2RSTy — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 24, 2020
Trump invoked a nearly identical talking point a couple hours later in Circleville, Ohio, saying, “You know what? On November 4, you’re not gonna hear— the news, CNN, all they talk about, ‘**Covid** **Covid** **Covid**.’ If a plane goes down with 500 people, they don’t talk about ... they’re trying to scare everybody.”
Then, on Saturday night in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Trump argued, falsely, that the main reason cases in the US are going up is because the US does so much testing — “if we did half the testing, we’d have half the cases,” he said, as if testing causes cases — and insisted the coronavirus is “going away.” (In recent weeks, new cases have actually grown at a much faster rate than testing has expanded.)
Trump still thinks public health measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus are the fruit of a Democratic hoax to take him out. He also seems to (falsely) believe that without testing, there would be no coronavirus cases. pic.twitter.com/33wtRDVrDy — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 25, 2020
Trump echoed the same theme during his first rally of the day on Sunday in Londonderry, New Hampshire.

Not only is Trump’s rhetoric irresponsible, but the fact is, he’s holding rallies that make a mockery of social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines recommended by his own government. And these rallies appear to be actively making the pandemic worse by spreading the virus.
Perhaps the strongest evidence of this came on Friday, when Erin Mansfield, Josh Salman, and Dinah Voyles Pulver authored a piece for USA Today that examined how coronavirus cases surged in a number of places where Trump recently held rallies.
From the article:
The president has participated in nearly three dozen rallies since mid-August, all but two at airport hangars. A USA TODAY analysis shows **COVID**-19 cases grew at a faster rate than before after at least five of those rallies in the following counties: Blue Earth, Minnesota; Lackawanna, Pennsylvania; Marathon, Wisconsin; Dauphin, Pennsylvania; and Beltrami, Minnesota. Together, those counties saw 1,500 more new cases in the two weeks following Trump’s rallies than the two weeks before – 9,647 cases, up from 8,069.
But to the extent that Trump actually engages with this reality, his message is that people have to learn to live with it.
“You have to lead your life, and you have to get out,” he advised his fans on Saturday in Ohio.
The White House has no plan — and they aren’t even trying to hide it
Beyond the mounting human toll — more than 220,000 Americans have now died from the coronavirus — the latest spike in cases comes at a politically inopportune time for the White House, with Election Day now just nine days away.
But at this point, the Trump administration isn’t even pretending to have a plan to slow the spread of the virus. Instead, during a CNN interview on Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said, revealingly, that “we’re not going to control the pandemic.”
MEADOWS: We're not going to control the pandemic
TAPPER: Why not?
M: Because it's a contagious virus
T: Why not make efforts to contain it?
M: What we need to do is make sure we have the proper mitigation factors to make sure people don't die pic.twitter.com/0DYgk4rB3T — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 25, 2020
Meanwhile, the White House is dealing with yet another cluster of cases — five people close to Vice President Mike Pence have tested positive for the virus in recent days. Pence, the chair of the White House coronavirus task force, was exposed. But instead of following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, which calls for exposed people to self-quarantine for 14 days, he plans to travel to pandemic rallies on Sunday and Monday.
So not only has the White House given up on protecting the American public, but Trump administration officials have failed to protect themselves. And Trump and Pence are actively making things worse by lying to the American public about the state of the pandemic at rallies that fuel further spread."
2020-12-15 16:20:00,vox.com,6.735847,Lean Left,"The many strange long-term symptoms of Covid-19, explained","When Heather-Elizabeth Brown spiked a fever in April in Detroit, the only reason she was able to get a coronavirus test was because she was volunteering as a police chaplain and was therefore considered an essential worker. Her results came back negative, and she was relieved. But then, she says, “I just got sicker and sicker.”
After being turned away from overcrowded ERs twice, Brown was eventually admitted on her third try. She finally tested positive, and by that point, she was severely ill. She was put on a ventilator and spent the next 31 days in a medically induced coma.
Before **Covid**-19, Brown was a healthy, active Black woman in her 30s. “But when I came off the ventilator, they had to coach me how to breathe.” The smallest pleasures — like eating a sliver of ice after her feeding tube was removed — became something to treasure.
Six months later, Brown is still very ill. She has been hospitalized for blood clots and has lingering heart problems, nerve pain, and extreme fatigue. “Even making breakfast is now out of the question,” she says. Most troublingly, she’s still experiencing severe brain fog, which makes it hard for her to return to work.
Brown is just one of many previously healthy people whose life has been derailed after a **Covid**-19 infection. While early research on **Covid**-19 focused on its respiratory symptoms, we now know its impacts — both direct and indirect — can be much more extensive and relentless.
On December 3, the National Institutes of Health held a two-day seminar on what has come to be called long **Covid**, or long-haul **Covid** — cases of lingering symptoms that can last for weeks or months after an initial infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently created a list of some of the persistent symptoms patients are experiencing, which include chest pain, brain fog, fatigue, and hair loss — with patients reporting many others as well.
Because these patients don’t all have the same symptoms, they will need different kinds of post-**Covid** care. And the NIH made clear that there are still many more questions than answers — including whose symptoms might linger for months, and how to treat them.
Almost a year into the pandemic, there have not yet been thorough, large-scale studies to determine the true prevalence of long **Covid**. But preliminary research suggests that somewhere between 10 percent and 88 percent of **Covid**-19 patients will experience at least one symptom for many weeks or months. Some of these can be life-altering; one study found that 50 percent of non-ICU patients reported a significant change to their cognitive functioning.
Doctors at the seminar said they were surprised by the scope of long **Covid** and its potential socioeconomic impacts. “This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who spoke at the event.
Related A doctor on 9 things that could go wrong with the new vaccines
Even if the prevalence ends up being on the lower end of the 10 to 88 percent range, the sheer volume of people getting sick means there are already millions of Americans who have, and will soon have, long **Covid**. Despite the staggering numbers, “we’re a hidden group of people,” Brown says. This can make getting treatment from skeptical physicians challenging. Long-**Covid** patient Anthony Campbell, for example, had a doctor refuse to sign a work disability form unless he was treated for anxiety rather than for his persistent symptoms.
Interviews with dozens of patients like Brown and Campbell provide a closer look at long Covid’s devastating impact — and the clues the latest research offers into what might be causing all these symptoms, including erectile dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, hallucinations, and dementia-like effects that can severely impact daily life.
Menstrual changes and erectile dysfunction
One of the most surprising new findings about long Covid’s effects is that both women and men have reported sexual and reproductive system symptoms following a **Covid**-19 infection.
The Patient-Led Research Group, a team of researchers who are also **Covid**-19 patients, conducted a survey of 640 long-**Covid** patients and recorded more than 200 total symptoms, including testicular pain, urinary problems, and menstrual changes.
“A lot of people with long **Covid** notice that their symptoms get worse just before their period happens,” when estrogen levels are lowest, says Louise Newson, a general practitioner and menopause specialist. She says an additional sign hormones may be involved are long-**Covid** symptoms like “brain fog, fatigue, dizziness, joint pain — these are also symptoms of menopause.”
Newson has 842 patient responses so far to a pilot survey, and she says the results “confirm my thoughts that long **Covid** is likely to be related to low hormone levels (estrogen and testosterone), which so far have been neglected with research.” Estrogen plays a key role in women’s health, and having abnormally low levels can lead to infertility, osteoporosis, lack of sex drive, and depression.
Newson says that anecdotally, patients with long **Covid** from her menopause clinic have improved with the right dose and type of hormone replacement therapy. “They all had low oestradiol and low testosterone results before treatment,” she says.
Long **Covid** can also significantly impact male reproductive systems and testosterone levels. “Absolutely, reproductive systems have been overlooked during the pandemic,” says Geoff Hackett, a professor of sexual medicine at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. He explains that during acute illness, the testes can be attacked by the virus directly.
“The testes are one of the highest sites of ACE2 expression,” writes the British Society of Sexual Medicine (BSSM) in its position paper on **Covid**-19. (This ACE2 enzyme is the primary way SARS-CoV-2 enters cells.) The BSSM adds that SARS-CoV-2 also damages cells on the inner surface of blood vessels called endothelial cells, a condition which is “frequently present in men with erectile dysfunction and testosterone deficiency.”
Several recent studies have pointed to testosterone, which in men is produced in the testes, as playing an important role in coronavirus patients: A study in Germany found that the majority of men admitted to the hospital with **Covid**-19 had low testosterone levels and high inflammatory markers. (This study was unable to determine if these low testosterone levels predated their coronavirus infection.)
A similar study in Italy found low testosterone levels predicted worse outcomes in hospitalized patients. A third study, in Wuhan, China, also found low testosterone levels in coronavirus patients, which they said required “more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.”
Hypogonadism, when sex organs don’t produce sufficient hormones, affects both the production of testosterone and sperm. Another recent paper, published in The Lancet, found the production of sperm was impaired in **Covid**-19 patients, which they said might be explained by an immune response in the testes. In some patients, they also found auto-immune orchitis, or inflammation of the testis with specific anti-sperm antibodies. “There does seem to be some evidence for relative infertility afterward,” Hackett says, though he cautions it’s too early to say if it would be permanent.
In general, “attacking the cells of the testes will have an adverse effect on erections,” Hackett says. Even beyond a direct effect, endothelial disorder and inflammation may affect the arteries in the penis, making erections more difficult. “Erectile dysfunction is going to be highly prevalent, particularly if you look at the groups at high risk of **Covid**-19,” Hackett says. “Seventy-five percent of diabetics have erectile dysfunction anyway.” Based on anecdotal evidence, the next Patient-Led Research Group survey will include questions on shrinkage, erectile dysfunction, and testicular pain.
Erectile function is a sign of overall health, and urologist Ryan Berglund of the Cleveland Clinic recently made a statement that for young and healthy people who develop this problem after having **Covid**-19, “this can be a sign of something more serious going on.”
The BSSM is concerned that these reproductive effects may have lasting implications, warning that low testosterone levels in men “are associated with increased mortality,” and that those “who may have survived the current pandemic ... may be at considerable risk from second and third wave infection, or future viral pandemics.”
Beyond **Covid**-19, research suggested a connection between viral infections of the central nervous system and pituitary dysfunction. A significant number of viruses have previously been associated with the onset of Type 1 diabetes, and it appears there may have been an increase in diabetes diagnoses during the pandemic.
Recognizing these impacts may help doctors find effective treatments; Hackett says a common erectile dysfunction treatment, Tadalafil, improves all markers of endothelial disease. “If it didn’t give men an erection, it would be treated as a serious cardiovascular drug,” he says. He notes that mountain climbers often take Tadalafil before big climbs to avoid altitude sickness, as it lowers pulmonary artery pressure and improves the endothelium of arteries — effects that might significantly help **Covid**-19 patients.
But Hackett says even as the UK National Health System rolls out long-**Covid** clinics, he’s been disappointed to see these symptoms overlooked. “Their strategies include things like eating healthy, hydrating, and mindfulness,” he says. “How is this going to go down with seriously ill people? All they’re offering is platitudes.”
Pulmonary problems
Long-**Covid** symptoms can be very diverse and are often not limited to one part of the body, making them hard to understand. One of the reasons long-**Covid** patients are struggling to do high-quality research through their illnesses, says Hannah Davis, a long-**Covid** patient and a member of the Patient-Led Research Group who helped design the survey, “is that we need answers.”
She’s tired of being told that no one knows how to help treat her symptoms, or how many others might be experiencing something similar. “We’re going to get answers faster than anyone else because we’re living this experience,” Davis says. One recent study of 201 long-**Covid** patients in the UK found that even in a young, low-risk population, 66 percent had impairments to one or more organs four months after their initial symptoms.
Being sick enough to be ventilated, like Brown was, often comes with its own complications; one study found that 81 percent of ventilated patients develop delirium, and one in five patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome — a common lung condition in ICU patients — experience long-term cognitive impairment. But even coronavirus patients with milder symptoms or no initial symptoms at all can develop long **Covid**.
Long-term lung problems are perhaps the most straightforward long-**Covid** symptom, as the virus can directly inflame the lung tissue, filling air sacs with fluid and making them less elastic and harder to expand as you breathe. Even at the beginning of the pandemic, it was known that previous coronavirus epidemics had caused lung scarring in some patients. One 15-year study of 71 SARS patients from a 2003 outbreak found a third had reduced lung capacity; a third of MERS survivors in a 2017 study also had long-term lung damage.
New research suggests that around half of asymptomatic **Covid**-19 infections can also cause damage to the lungs.
In early November, a study published in The Lancet on 41 autopsies of **Covid**-19 patients offered a possible reason: It found that the virus caused major structural changes in the lungs, including extensive blood clotting, scarring of respiratory tissue, and the fusion of many smaller cells into larger cells. (Based on the fact that these were autopsies, these were all severe cases, limiting the implications that can be drawn.)
The authors suggest that, unlike other types of pneumonia, these structural changes may stem “from the persistence of infected and dysfunctional cells in the lungs” — which may help explain why some of these symptoms linger. Though we still don’t know the exact mechanics, continuing lung symptoms are perhaps the most common of them.
It’s still unclear how long these symptoms might last; some long-**Covid** patients have reported improvements in their breathing, although much slower than they would have liked. One study of mildly ill patients in China found that 70 percent had abnormal lung scans three months after their initial illness.
Blood clotting and other cardiovascular issues
Early in the pandemic, doctors noticed that many **Covid**-19 patients were having serious blood clotting problems, with reports of clogging dialysis machines and clots in the arms and legs called deep vein thromboses. But some patients, like Brown — who went back to the hospital with blood clots three months after her initial symptoms — are also experiencing clots weeks or months later.
Large blood clots can cause tissue damage, requiring amputations. Smaller clots can restrict blood flow in the lungs, impairing normal oxygen exchange. If clots travel to the brain or heart, they can also cause strokes or heart attacks, as 23-year-old Riley Behrens recently suffered after a coronavirus infection. “Before this, I was a healthy young athlete with no major medical conditions,” she tweeted after a **Covid**-related stroke. “Now, I’m being told I will likely never return to contact sports because of lasting lung and brain damage. The risk for a second stroke will always be there.”
It’s hard to know how common clotting problems are in **Covid**-19 patients, but reports of conditions linked to clotting have certainly increased: A study published in Annals of Vascular Surgery recently found a twofold increase during the pandemic in major amputations, which are sometimes required after a clot is found. And multiple researchers have reported a spike in the number of stroke patients, including young people like Behrens who would not normally be at high risk for strokes, as well as in patients who didn’t know they’d had the coronavirus but later tested positive for antibodies.
A study published in Science in mid-November may have identified one of the reasons for this abnormal clotting: In half of 172 hospitalized coronavirus patients, the scientists found autoantibodies — proteins that are supposed to defend against invaders that instead start to attack the body’s own cells. When these autoantibodies were injected into lab mice, the animals developed blood clots. The researchers suggest that these proteins could be sparking a dangerous loop between clotting and hyperinflammation. A December preprint also found a significant percentage of **Covid**-19 patients developed autoantibodies, and the more severe their symptoms, the more autoantibodies they had.
But **Covid**-19’s cardiovascular impacts don’t end with coagulation. Half of 1,216 **Covid**-19 patients in one study also had heart abnormalities, and one in seven had severe cardiac issues.
“People can present without any lung symptoms, and have just heart or brain involvement,” says Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. These can include cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump; myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, the two thin layers of tissue that surround the heart and help it function. One study on 54 college athletes who’d had mild **Covid**-19 cases found that a third had pericarditis, even though about the same number had been asymptomatic.
Many long-**Covid** patients are also experiencing persistent heart concerns months after their initial illness. Kate Meredith of Beverly, Massachusetts, for example, first got sick in March. Now, she has tachycardia, or an abnormally elevated heart rate. “If I get up to do the dishes, it jumps to 140 [beats per minute],” she says.
Leticia Soares and Israel Slick, of Ontario, both also got **Covid**-19 in April. They each independently reported heart palpitations and tachycardia to the same doctor, who speculated Slick’s condition might be related to his **Covid**-19 infection, while Soares, who is Latina, was told to seek counseling. (Many Black and brown long-**Covid** patients say they’ve experienced gaslighting and medical racism when they try to seek treatment.)
Cardiovascular symptoms may arise from the coronavirus directly impacting the endothelium. These cells control vascular functions, including enzymes that direct blood clotting. The endothelium is also important for proper immune function, and its imbalance could help explain the cytokine storms seen in many patients with severe **Covid**-19 cases. “There’s no shortage of ways by which this virus can hurt the heart,” Topol concludes.
Immune system
Damaged endothelial cells can also stimulate mast cells, a type of blood cell that’s part of the immune system. Their job is to defend against foreign bodies by releasing chemicals like histamines. Activated mast cells were recently found in autopsies of **Covid**-19 patients and are linked to clots and pulmonary edemas.
Some long-**Covid** patients are reporting symptoms and inflammation similar to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a chronic, multisystem condition that causes allergic responses, GI problems, and neurological issues.
Frances Simpson, a psychology lecturer at Coventry University in the UK, says she and her 5- and 9-year old were infected with **Covid**-19 in March and have had long-**Covid** symptoms since, including new allergic reactions. “When you read about possible mast cell activation syndrome,” she says, “we can tick all of the symptoms off between us” — things like headaches, rashes, and extreme fatigue. Moreover, some of the drugs that have been shown to help with severe **Covid**-19 cases, like famotidine and aspirin, inhibit mast cell activation.
Immunology is very complicated, but it also appears that T cells, an important component of the immune system, may also play a role in long **Covid**, as they do in other inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.
The CDC is now calling a particular set of inflammatory symptoms in multiple organs after an initial infection multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults, or MIS-A — after a similar post-viral condition that was first reported in children, called MIS-C. Both children’s and adults’ symptoms in these cases overlap with MCAS, with problems like chest tightness, abdominal pain, rash, and inflammation, strengthening the argument that mast cells may be involved.
Nervous system
New research is also homing in on the many, sometimes severe, neurological symptoms that long-**Covid** patients have reported. One peer-reviewed paper found that a surprising 40 percent of patients with **Covid**-19 showed some kind of neurologic manifestation, and more than 30 percent had impaired cognition. These symptoms — including brain fog, extreme fatigue, difficulty with short-term memory, intense headaches, and tingling or numbness — are common in long-**Covid** patients.
Some long-**Covid** patients develop dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that can be triggered by viral infections. The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions in our bodies such as heart rate and digestion. When it is damaged by an infection, these functions can go out of whack.
Davis, for example, has been diagnosed with a form of dysautonomia called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), where blood vessels don’t respond to chemical signals efficiently. When she stands, blood pools in her lower extremities, making her feel faint and exacerbating her brain fog. The nervous system continues to release hormones to tighten her non-responding blood vessels, increasing her heart rate and making her shake.
There’s also increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can actually cross the blood-brain barrier, a layer of specialized cells that protect the brain, and harm the nervous system directly. In April, researchers found that a 40-year-old woman in Los Angeles with headaches, seizures, and hallucinations had RNA from the coronavirus in her cerebrospinal fluid.
One study recently found an explanation for how that may have occurred: The virus can directly enter and damage cells in the brain’s choroid plexus, which has cells with ACE2 receptors. “This can lead to leakage across this important barrier, that normally prevents entry of pathogens into the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain,” says study co-author Madeline Lancaster, a biologist and the group leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.
The brain is normally protected from your blood, so it’s a big problem to have that barrier penetrated. During viral infections, many immune cells are activated and circulating through the body. Lancaster explains that even if the virus itself doesn’t get past the barrier, having “those inflammatory cytokines leak into the brain, where they really do not belong, can have serious repercussions.” One example is encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain itself, as found in this study of 12 **Covid**-19 patients in the UK.
Lancaster says viruses may penetrate the blood-brain barrier more often than previously thought. “The **Covid** crisis has shined a light on overlooked post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),” she says. “There’s a lot of indication that inflammation of the brain can lead to those symptoms. There’s a huge overlap between those conditions and long **Covid**.”
But though post-viral symptoms may linger for months or even years, it can be hard for doctors to find clues in neurological tests. While encephalitis can be seen on MRIs, damage to the cerebrospinal fluid might not be visible. (Doctors can, however, look for elevated biomarkers like cytokines.) “Unfortunately, that’s one of the reasons a lot of patients with CFS have been told it’s all in their heads. We’ve let those patients down,” says Lancaster.
Neuro-inflammation can cause emotional and behavioral changes. Sammie, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy, says she and her daughter were both infected in the UK with **Covid**-19 in March. Since then, her 15-year-old daughter has had headaches, dysautonomia, fatigue, and extreme anxiety and emotional outbursts. “She’s not a crier. She’s normally very stoic,” Sammie says, but over the last few months, “she’s had irrational outbursts, just sobbing her heart out.”
One study of 62,354 patients recently published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal found that one in five were diagnosed with a mental health disorder within three months of testing positive for the coronavirus. “But what’s the chicken and what’s the egg?” Lancaster asks. “It could be that there are people with leakier brains to start with, who when they get **Covid**-19 are more likely to have viral entry into their brain.”
Neuro-inflammation might also help explain some of the weirder long-**Covid** symptoms reported by parents of children who have had **Covid**-19, like something called Alice in Wonderland syndrome, an alteration of visual perception where objects or body part sizes are perceived incorrectly. Simpson says her son’s vision regularly goes blurry, and he describes people’s heads “going small.”
Gretchen Drown of Portland, Maine, also says that her 15-year old son, who got **Covid**-19 in March, describes “things looking weird,” and that during these episodes, his pupils get strangely dilated. Drown’s son also now has headaches and extreme fatigue, which worsen after he overexerts himself, making it hard to keep up with school.
Damaging the blood-brain barrier also hurts its ability to make cerebrospinal fluid, which is important for providing nutrients to the brain and removing its normal waste. Lancaster calls the cerebrospinal fluid the plumbing system of the brain. “Imagine your house with all your toilets clogged — a similar thing can happen in the brain,” she says.
Much of this fluid cycling normally occurs during sleep, so Lancaster suggests that Alice in Wonderland syndrome — and possibly other common neurological symptoms in long **Covid**, like extreme fatigue and insomnia — might be related to the virus compromising the body’s ability to generate and manage this fluid.
Children and long **Covid**
As the pandemic began, it appeared most children had mild cases of **Covid**-19. But while clinicians have not been tracking long **Covid** in children, it’s clear from the many parents Vox interviewed that children of any age can and do experience persistent symptoms that can completely alter their ability to function.
That no one seems to be paying attention to pediatric long-**Covid** cases is a source of extreme frustration. Multiple parents reported that during their efforts to get their children care, medical providers accused them of Munchausen syndrome, a psychological disorder where someone pretends to be ill.
Sammie says when a nurse suggested it to her, “I literally think if I hadn’t had a mask on, my jaw would have fallen off. I felt so broken — it makes me feel emotional talking about it now.” Since then, she’s complained to the clinic and actually gotten a letter of apology. But her experience demonstrates the hurdles parents face in getting their children the care they need. “I think there are a lot more children who are ill, and who no one is connecting the dots for,” Sammie says.
While it’s hard to quantify something no one is tracking, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests about 11 percent of US **Covid**-19 cases are children, with over 1,460,905 children contracting the virus as of December 3. It’s easier to count more acute **Covid**-19 consequences, like MIS-C: In one study of kids under 18 with MIS-C, 14.8 percent exhibited new neurological symptoms like headaches, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. The youngest child with persistent symptoms Vox found was 18 months; the oldest was 15.
While some of the symptoms parents have reported in children are similar to adult long-**Covid** cases — headaches, extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating or forming new memories, anxiety, depression, tachycardia, dysautonomia, lingering or recurrent fevers — others differ. Some parents in the long-**Covid** kids online group Sammie formed, for example, have been reporting frequent nosebleeds.
Some of the parents, like Simpson, are themselves suffering from long **Covid**. “In many families who have kids with long **Covid**, there’s a mother or father who has it as well. People should be tripping over themselves to research if this is genetic,” she says.
But in the meantime, for parents like Sammie, Simpson, Meredith, and Drown, there are few resources to help their children recover. Though it hasn’t been easy, Sammie hasn’t given up trying to get her daughter into more specialized care. “If I don’t advocate for my child, who the hell is going to do it?” she asks.
Parents worry about how their children’s lives might be impacted by the long-term effects of this disease. For adult patients, too, the repercussions are potentially huge.
One doctor, whose family asked that her name be withheld for privacy reasons, first got sick this spring. She eventually despaired of finding treatment for her long-**Covid** symptoms. She recently drove to New York — because she wanted to be near the best researchers she knew of — before ending her life. She donated her body to science.
For those who survive, like Brown, the questions are pervasive. “How will this affect me when I want to have a baby?” Brown asks. “What is next? We have no idea. No one can tell me anything specific.” She’s frustrated that friends her age still assume that if they get infected, they’ll recover.
“You might be okay, but you might not,” Brown says. She says she’s angry about how the pandemic has been measured in deaths rather than in lives disrupted. “The disparities are shocking. And more will be lost if we don’t make adjustments.”

2020-05-05 10:50:00,vox.com,6.7283826,Lean Left,"Covid-19 is way, way worse than the flu","Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, the question on many people’s minds was: “Isn’t this disease like the flu?” **Covid**-19 is a respiratory disease with some symptoms that resemble those of the seasonal flu, like fever and cough.
New evidence in the form of blood tests conducted in New York show that **Covid**-19 is at least as deadly as scientists have suspected for some weeks now. This is not like the seasonal flu. It is worse.
This is not to downplay the flu, which is an annual blight we could be even more proactive about fighting (annual flu shots are important!). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that between 12,000 and 61,000 people die of the flu every year. (President Trump has routinely sought to downplay the **Covid**-19 pandemic — particularly early on — by making comparisons to the flu.)
But also, keep in mind: That’s in a given year. **Covid**-19 hasn’t been around a year — or even half a year. Before January, this virus was not known to science, at all.
Yet the virus is already responsible for around 69,000 recorded deaths in the US as of May 5; and this is almost certainly an undercount. Around 2,000 people are still dying of **Covid**-19 every day in the United States alone.
While there is still a lot of uncertainty about the coronavirus and how it will play out, based on what we know so far, this is a threat to take extremely seriously.
Reasons why **Covid**-19 is worse than the flu
While the exact global death rate is not yet clear, the evidence so far shows that the disease kills a larger proportion of people than the flu (and it’s particularly lethal for people older than 80).
This can be confusing because there are two figures used to describe how deadly a virus is. There’s the case fatality rate — the rate of deaths resulting from a given number of confirmed cases. And there’s the infection fatality ratio — the rate of deaths per infection, including asymptomatic infections and mild cases.
April data from New York suggests that the infection fatality rate of **Covid**-19 was between 0.5 and 0.8 percent, which matches international estimates. Estimates of case fatality rates are higher and vary quite a bit country by country.
That infection fatality rate for **Covid**-19 is much, much higher than the flu, which has an infection fatality rate of around 0.02 to 0.05 percent, according to infectious disease epidemiologist Adam Kucharski on Twitter. This means **Covid**-19 may be more than 10 times more deadly than the flu.
So if we're calculating risk infection is fatal, we need to compare total flu infections - potentially 1/3 of population - with annual deaths. As rough estimate, this suggests 0.02-0.05% of flu infections are fatal, i.e. 10x lower than **COVID** (Data: https://t.co/MA6BixjgQW) 5/ — Adam Kucharski (@AdamJKucharski) March 27, 2020
Comparing **Covid**-19 deaths to flu deaths may be misleading in another way, Harvard physician Jeremy Samuel Faust writes in Scientific American. The CDC flu death figures “are estimates that the CDC produces by multiplying the number of flu death counts reported by various coefficients produced through complicated algorithms,” Faust writes. The data we have on **Covid**-19 deaths are of recorded deaths. It’s possible that the CDC is overestimating the mortality of the flu. So comparing the two isn’t apples to apples.
But comparing recorded flu deaths to recorded **Covid**-19 deaths is also telling. Faust writes:
If we compare, for instance, the number of people who died in the United States from **COVID**-19 in the second full week of April to the number of people who died from influenza during the worst week of the past seven flu seasons (as reported to the CDC), we find that the novel coronavirus killed between 9.5 and 44 times more people than seasonal flu. In other words, the coronavirus is not anything like the flu: It is much, much worse.
The death rate isn’t the only reason why **Covid**-19 is worse. It also has a higher potential to overwhelm America’s health care system and threaten people with other illnesses or underlying conditions. Currently, there is no vaccine for the virus, nor any approved therapeutics to slow the course of its toll on the human body.
Biologically, it behaves differently than the flu. It takes one to 14 days for people with **Covid**-19 to develop symptoms (five days is the median). For the flu, it’s around two days. That potentially gives people more time to spread the illness asymptomatically before they know they are sick.
It’s estimated that 25 percent or more of **Covid**-19 infections may be asymptomatic. That’s greater than for the flu; about 16 percent of flu cases are asymptomatic, a recent Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy report notes. “Thus, while both viruses can lead to asymptomatic infections, the asymptomatic fraction appears to be somewhat higher for **COVID**-19 than for influenza,” the report says.
That makes this virus sneaky. The report also says there’s evidence to suggest that presymptomatic transmission (transmission before someone feels sick) is more common with **Covid**-19 than the flu.
Some flu seasons are worse than others — but facilities can anticipate flu cases and prepare for them. Many hospitals, as Vox’s Dylan Scott has reported, have struggled in their preparations for **Covid**-19.
Several months ago, the coronavirus was believed to have made the leap from animals to humans. As far as scientists know, no human immune system had seen it before November, so there was no natural immunity to it. That means **Covid**-19 is more contagious than the flu — about twice as contagious, perhaps more; the numbers are still being worked out.
When a flu pandemic came through in the past, “there was there was already a lot of pre existing immunity to the virus,” Sarah Cobey, a University of Chicago infectious disease modeler, says. It’s unclear if there’s any preexisting immunity for **Covid**-19 based on exposure to other coronavirus strains.
The threat of it causing more outbreaks that overwhelm health systems around the world is serious. It’s bad enough to roil stock markets, put people out of work, and cause a recession. It could potentially kill millions, both in the US and abroad, in the next year or two.
It’s also possible that **Covid**-19 will become endemic — meaning a disease that regularly attacks humans and will not go away until there’s a treatment or a vaccine.
Again: Yes, flu variants are estimated to kill tens of thousands of people a year in the US. But we still have the flu. And now we have a new burden on top of that — making everything worse."
2020-09-09 10:30:48,thefederalist.com,6.723592,Lean Right,Lockdowns Are Now A Political Issue For Every Official On The Ballot,"Americans on either side of the debates surrounding **COVID**-19 need to hear how office-seekers would respond to the next **COVID**-19 spike, pandemic, or flu.
“I would shut it down,” Vice President Joe Biden recently promised when asked how he would respond to **COVID**-19 flareups, “I would listen to the scientists.” After experimenting with that option in March and April, President Donald Trump has vowed, “We won’t be closing the country again.”
The Trump-Biden divergence on this issue provides a clarifying distinction as Americans head into the home stretch of the 2020 presidential election. But what about gubernatorial, mayoral, and school-board elections, and what about elections beyond 2020? Knowing where a candidate stands on this issue — which affects every American — will be important for years to come.
Americans on either side of the **COVID**-19 divide — those who believe they have to take individual responsibility, who recall that America didn’t shut down during the pandemics of 1957 or 1968, who believe life must go on to preserve individual liberty, as well as those who believe in promoting social responsibility, who view **COVID**-19 as more deadly than past pandemics, and who believe life must change to preserve public health — would benefit from knowing how politicians would respond to the next **COVID**-19 spike, pandemic, or flu.
The Likelihood of Another Chinese Virus
Through either China’s incompetence or intention, another virus of the sort of **COVID**-19 will likely be unleashed upon the world in the future. H5N1, SARS, and **COVID**-19 are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths globally, and each began in China.
We now know Xi Jinping’s regime lied about the human-to-human transmission of **COVID**-19, allowed thousands to leave Wuhan for destinations around the world, ordered scientists not to share findings of coronavirus-genome sequencing, and carried out a premeditated plan to hoard 2.5 billion pieces of medical gear as the virus swept the globe.
It can no longer be hidden: China is an ends-justify-the-means regime that has disdain for human life and norms of behavior. It’s a place physicians are arrested and left to die for trying to live up to the oaths of medicine. It’s where Christians are sent to reeducation camps, Buddhist temples are bulldozed, Uighur Muslim men are herded into concentration camps, Uighur women are forcibly sterilized, and Uighur babies are forcibly aborted.
As dissident leader Xu Zhangrun observes, “A polity that is blatantly incapable of treating its own people properly can hardly be expected to treat the rest of the world well.”
The Unintended Consequences of Lockdowns
In truth, the lockdown way of life is an enemy of life and living. The lockdowns effectively prevented hundreds of millions of Americans from gathering for worship, cost tens of millions their jobs, and permanently shuttered more than 100,000 U.S. businesses. The isolation, job loss, and depression triggered by the lockdowns will lead to 75,000 deaths from drug abuse, alcoholism, and suicide. Not even the more than $3.2 trillion in deficit spending since March can cure despair.
Millions of surgeries have been delayed. Heart-attack death rates have spiked not because of **COVID**-19, but because the fear of **COVID**-19 kept patients away from getting the care they urgently needed. Researchers project 10,000 excess cancer deaths in America as a result of delayed screening caused by lockdowns. Half of cancer patients have missed chemotherapy treatments, transplants are down almost 85 percent, and emergency stroke evaluations are down 40 percent.
Brookings concludes, “The **COVID**-19 episode will likely lead to a large, lasting baby bust … a drop of perhaps 300,000 to 500,000 births in the U.S” next year. This is not a function of deaths among women of childbearing age, but of despair and uncertainty.
Domestic violence and childhood malnutrition have surged during the lockdown. Some 212,500 cases of child abuse have gone unreported due to the lockdown — a consequence of kids not being in school, where abuse is often first detected. Indeed, we may never be able to quantify the costs of a year without classroom instruction, which is why the American Academy of Pediatrics calls for reopening schools.
Data — not wildly inaccurate computer models — tell us why doctors say it’s safe to return to classroom instruction: **COVID**-19 poses an almost imperceivably small risk to Americans younger than 24, with that age group representing just 0.1 percent of **COVID**-19 deaths. Americans 14 and younger account for 145 **COVID**-19 deaths according to the Centers for Disease Control. Yet governors, mayors, and school boards claim to know more than pediatricians about child wellbeing.
Taking a Pledge
Rather than closing the schools, quarantining the healthy, and idling the economy, Sunetra Gupta, an Oxford University professor of infectious-disease epidemiology, has argued for months that we must find “a way of living with this virus.” Both history and science tell us that the lockdown way of life isn’t the answer to pandemics.
Yes, **COVID**-19’s infection-mortality rate was initially thought to be 3.4 percent, which understandably terrified policymakers. But as we learned more about the virus, the actual infection-mortality rate rapidly emerged in the data. As the Hoover Institution’s Scott Atlas explained in congressional testimony The virus kills between 0.1 percent and 0.4 percent of those infected. The seasonal flu, by comparison, kills about 0.1 percent of the infected.
Those who argue government reaction to **COVID**-19 is at best ahistorical and, at worst, draconian, must concede that **COVID**-19 could be more deadly than the flu. At the same time, those who support federal, state, and local government responses to **COVID**-19 must concede that **COVID**-19 is definitively not another Spanish Flu. It’s not even another H2N2 pandemic, which killed 0.67 percent of those infected in 1957.
In raw numbers, **COVID**-19 has claimed more than 190,000 Americans out of a population of 331.3 million. That sounds like a high death toll until we compare it to that 1957 pandemic, which claimed 116,000 Americans out of a population of 171 million. Even with the expansive accounting methods used by New York, Colorado, Washington, and key federal officials (who argue that dying with **COVID**-19 is the same as dying from **COVID**-19), this disease is less deadly than the 1957 flu.
According to Anthony Fauci, “The overall clinical consequences of **COVID**-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1 percent) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968).”
The numbers and Fauci’s assessment force us to ponder the policy reactions triggered by **COVID**-19. We didn’t close churches, schools, or businesses, cancel sports seasons, or amass staggering debt in response to pandemics in 1957 or 1968. But we did in 2020. Is this the new-normal response to viruses?
Candidates at every level of government should follow the lead of President Trump and Vice President Biden and go on the record answering that question. Lockdown opponents could call it the “Liberty from Lockdowns Pledge.” Lockdown supporters could call it the “Pandemic Protection Pledge.”
Similar pledges help Americans know where policymakers stand on taxation, abortion, fossil fuels, the Second Amendment, Social Security, campaign finance. We need a similar pledge for something with the potential to have such a monumental effect on our society.
There are Democratic and Republican officials who support the lockdown way of life, and there are Democratic and Republican officials who oppose the lockdown way of life. This isn’t a political issue so much as a philosophical one. These pledges would serve as a way for us to educate ourselves about the philosophical bent of those vying to run our school boards, cities, states, and country — and then, to vote accordingly."
2020-07-29 08:20:00,vox.com,6.717743,Lean Left,"The odd, growing list of Covid-19 symptoms, explained","More than six months into the coronavirus pandemic, the list of symptoms caused by the disease **Covid**-19 is still getting longer.
Beyond the most common symptoms of cough, fever, and shortness of breath, patients have reported other troubling maladies: vomiting, rashes, a loss of taste and smell, muscle aches, and even toe lesions dubbed “**Covid** toes.”
With more than 16.5 million confirmed cases worldwide, researchers are getting a better handle on the early warning signs of infection and how it plays out throughout the body during the course of the disease. These new insights into symptoms are shedding light on what the virus does to the body, when patients are at highest risk of infecting others, and potential ways to treat it.
And with a larger pool of people recovered from the infection, long-term effects of the illness are also emerging, including symptoms that won’t go away. “**Covid**-19 can result in prolonged illness, even among young adults without underlying chronic medical conditions,” according to a July 24 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. The same report found that one in three symptomatic adults who were surveyed still weren’t fully recovered between two and three weeks after testing positive for **Covid**-19.
“It is such a unique infection in its ability to cause so much damage in so many different ways, in so many different organ systems,” said Andrew Chan, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-founder of the **COVID** Symptom Study app. “It’s been very humbling for us as physicians and as a scientific community.”
The growing of list of **Covid**-19 symptoms, short- and long-term, is yet another example of our evolving understanding of the disease, from how it spreads to how long immunity may last to what treatments may be effective. There is likely much more still to learn about **Covid**-19 symptoms as scientists gather more data, but here is what they’ve uncovered in recent months about the signs of the disease, how clusters of symptoms can signal more severe complications, and the collateral damage throughout the body.
What the most recent evidence says about **Covid**-19 symptoms
A recent survey from the CDC identified several symptoms common across the infected. “Among 164 symptomatic **COVID**-19 patients, nearly all experienced fever, cough, or shortness of breath,” according to a July 17 report from the agency. “However, a wide variety of other symptoms were also reported; chills, myalgia [muscle soreness], headache, fatigue, and the presence of at least one [gastrointestinal] symptom (most commonly diarrhea) were each reported by >50% of patients.”
This aligns with earlier surveys, like one from the World Health Organization back in February, which found conventional symptoms of a respiratory infection were common in **Covid**-19 patients in China. The most common signs among more than 55,000 confirmed cases were: fever (87.9 percent of confirmed cases), dry cough (67.7 percent), fatigue (38.1 percent), sputum [phlegm] production (33.4 percent), shortness of breath (18.6 percent), sore throat (13.9 percent), and headache (13.6 percent).
But surveys like this from earlier in the pandemic had a harder time detecting milder symptoms. Most of the reports were among patients who were hospitalized or had received medical treatment for **Covid**-19, meaning they were already experiencing a severe course of the disease. People with less alarming signs were often not detected.
To suss out some of the more subtle symptoms of **Covid**-19, Harvard’s Chan and his team developed the **COVID** Symptom Study app, a mobile app that lets users self-report symptoms daily, whether or not they feel sick or have had a test for **Covid**-19.
The app has more than 4 million users in the US alone. By tracking symptoms across large groups of people, Chan and his collaborators have been able to identify emerging **Covid**-19 hot spots and detect new signals of the virus.
“The symptom that appears to be the strongest predictor of **Covid** continues to be a loss of taste or smell, and that’s been a thing that’s been continually shown in the data we’re getting in the app,” said Chan. “In particular, the fact that that symptom is relatively uncommon in other viral syndromes, certainly uncommon in seasonal allergies, makes it useful.”
The CDC added a loss of taste and smell to its symptoms guidelines in April, and Chan published his findings in a May 11 paper in the journal Nature Medicine.
Since it’s a more unique symptom to **Covid**-19 than fever, Chan suggested that screening for taste and smell could serve as a stopgap way to detect infections, especially in places with testing shortages and backlogs. “You can imagine that tests that are able to pick up a loss of smell might be easier to deploy at a large scale, might be more cost-efficient, and could really address some of the shortcomings of our present efforts with respect to testing,” Chan said.
Even more recently, the app has started to pick up signs that skin rashes — raised skin bumps, itchy and red skin, and inflammation on fingers and toes — could be a harbinger of **Covid**-19 for some. In a recent preprint paper, a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed, researchers conducted a subsequent survey based on these hints. They found that of 11,546 respondents, 17 percent of people with a confirmed **Covid**-19 infection reported that a rash was their first symptom. Of the patients reporting rashes, 21 percent said that rashes were their only symptom.
“Even though skin rashes may not be that common in **Covid**, the fact that they do arise, the fact that they may be a more specific sign, highlight how important it is to really assess their prevalence and how predictive they are,” Chan said.
Other preliminary studies, like one of 204 patients in China, found that more than half of **Covid**-19 patients experienced gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Some **Covid**-19 patients reported runny noses. Others experienced feelings of discomfort and malaise. In children, **Covid**-19 — even previously undetected cases — can spur an inflammatory condition similar to one known as Kawasaki disease. Several older people infected with the virus exhibited neurological maladies like confusion and seizures. Patients of all ages have also experienced abnormal blood clotting, causing strokes in otherwise healthy people.
Related How people without symptoms can still spread the coronavirus
In short, there are a lot of different ways that **Covid**-19 can show up in a person. But at the same time, an unknown number of people may be infected without showing any outward signs. Studies have found the share of asymptomatic patients can comprise anywhere from 18 percent to 40 percent of infected people.
The precise fraction of people infected with **Covid**-19 who are completely asymptomatic is still being studied, but it’s clear that there are infected people who can spread the virus without coughing or feeling feverish. Even among patients who do show symptoms, some studies have found that they are most infectious just before they start feeling off, rather than when they suffer their worst fevers, rashes, or breathing problems.
That means it’s critical to identify infected people as early as possible and have them isolate from others in order to control the pandemic. And while symptoms can serve as a diagnostic tool in a pinch, robust testing is still needed to identify hidden infections to contain the spread of **Covid**-19.
Clusters of **Covid**-19 symptoms can predict more severe complications from the infection
Many **Covid**-19 symptoms overlap with those of other illnesses, so the patterns of how they emerge together can be a more useful warning sign for the virus than any one symptom alone. In another preprint paper using data from the tracking app, researchers identified six distinct clusters of symptoms for **Covid**-19.
These groupings were associated with varying degrees of severity of illness. For instance, among patients experiencing one cluster of symptoms — headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, and muscle pain — 9.9 percent of them ended up needing supplemental oxygen or ventilation.
Meanwhile, patients who experienced the above symptoms, but in addition experienced shortness of breath, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, faced far more severe outcomes. About half of the patients with this second symptom cluster were hospitalized, and 19.8 percent of them required breathing support.
So it’s not just one symptom but several together that are associated with how the disease progresses. These clusters often emerge in the first five days of the illness, but people who need help breathing often arrive nearly two weeks after they first start showing signs. That means symptom clusters could serve as an early alert, helping health providers anticipate the likelihood of a patient needing to be hospitalized and perhaps prompt earlier treatment.
Being able to identify **Covid**-19 symptoms matters for preventing spread
When testing is slow or lacking, a cough and fever are often enough for a person to get diagnosed as a **Covid**-19 patient, with the associated protocols for isolation. And while waiting for a test result, people often have to decide how to isolate from others and take precautions based on what they feel.
After exposure to the virus, it can take two to 14 days for a patient to experience symptoms, if they feel them at all. During that time, these presymptomatic people can spread the virus to other people — especially in the couple of days before they start feeling sick.
Figuring out when key symptoms set in is also important because guidelines for distancing after an infection are often based on when they arise. “For most persons with **COVID**-19 illness, isolation and precautions can generally be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms,” according to new CDC guidance based on new information about how long the virus is active and transmissible (emphasis in the original document).
And as the recent findings about symptom clusters show, a specific group of warning signs can signal that a more severe course of the disease is in store in the coming days.
Some symptoms of **Covid**-19 stem from the immune system’s response
Fever, rashes, and inflammation are often the signs of the immune system’s battle with an infection. But sometimes, the immune system can overreact, causing conditions like cytokine storms where the body overproduces cytokines, signaling molecules that alert cells to an infection. That can cause immune cells to attack otherwise healthy cells, leading to the failure of organs like the liver and kidneys and, eventually, death. Even among survivors, this can cause lasting damage.
Still, despite its complexity as a disease, researchers are learning that **Covid**-19 operates in ways that are distinct from many other infections. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) stemming from **Covid**-19 is a case in point.
ARDS is a condition in some of the most severe **Covid**-19 cases, causing the lungs to flood with fluid, cutting off oxygen supply to the blood. Patients with ARDS often need to be treated with a ventilator and are frequently left with severe organ damage.
Nuala Meyer, a critical care lung doctor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine who studies ARDS, typically treats patients suffering with ARDS as the result of the flu. But, she said, “the patients we were seeing [with **Covid**-19] were quite different.”
With flu patients who have ARDS, doctors expect the very worst cases to be among those with asthma, or those who are immunocompromised. Instead, the worst-faring **Covid**-19 cases were more likely to have heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or obesity. “They generally did not have asthma,” Meyer said. “And some of the patients who were immunocompromised did do really poorly and others did surprisingly well.”
It’s been hard for doctors to predict which **Covid**-19 patients will fare worse, and develop severe complications like ARDS. But recently, a study from Meyer and her colleagues added new evidence to what’s long been a theory: that it’s not the virus that’s causing the symptoms, but the patient’s immune system.
In a study of 125 patients, Meyer and colleagues observed three different “immunotypes” or broad patterns of immune response, which may account for the range in severity of disease. It’s currently not clear what leads someone to one immune response or another, but this work, and other work like it, can lead to the detection of biomarkers that indicate people most likely to experience severe disease. Those who had some of the worst outcomes, and spent the most time on a hospital ventilator, were more likely to have dysregulated immune response, Meyers said.
“The fear is that either too persistent an [immune] activation or too robust an activation might contribute to the organ damage that we see,” she said. In Nature, researchers led by Akiko Iwasaki of Yale have noted that many of the most severe **Covid**-19 symptoms are correlated with an elevated cytokine response, which can lead to damaging inflammation.
The hope is, with a better understanding of the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, doctors could diagnose patients who are most likely to have this severe reaction, and take steps to prevent the worst reaction from occurring. “That’s where we’d certainly like to go,” Meyer said.
Researchers have already found that drugs that suppress the immune system like dexamethasone can save the lives of the most severely ill **Covid**-19 patients. But since it tamps down the immune response, it can cause a milder infection to get worse or leave a patient susceptible to another pathogen. That severely limits how useful it can be as a treatment, but it highlights the importance of tuning the immune system to thwart a disease without going any further.
Understanding the immune response to the virus is also critical to making a vaccine for **Covid**-19, a tool that can ultimately end the pandemic. As knowledge of **Covid**-19 and immunity improves, researchers expect to gain ground both in fighting the illness and preventing it altogether.
**Covid**-19 can have ripple effects throughout the body, but the process is still unclear
While **Covid**-19 is a respiratory infection, it’s become increasingly apparent in recent months that its effects can have cascading consequences throughout the body. Scientists are now piecing together the mechanisms behind these effects in hopes of stopping some of the worst outcomes and to get ahead of long-term problems.
Donald Landry, chair of the department of medicine at Columbia University, co-authored a recent study in the journal Nature Medicine looking at all the ways **Covid**-19 can impair the body beyond the lungs and airways. The list is long: blood clots, irregular heartbeat, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal distress, liver damage, high blood sugar, neurologic illnesses, vision problems, and skin complications.
To understand why, it helps to examine how the virus itself works. SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind **Covid**-19, starts an infection by docking one of its spike proteins with a receptor on a human cell known as ACE2, which is involved in the regulation of blood pressure. So the virus interfering with this mechanism can lead to problems stemming from constricted blood vessels. That interference, plus direct viral damage in blood vessels that have the ACE2 receptor, can cause inflammation and blood clots.
But the virus may be doing something else still unknown that’s causing blood clots. Landry noted that when **Covid**-19 patients were receiving treatments like ECMO and hemodialysis that involved circulating blood outside the body, the tubing transporting blood in and out of the body also clotted.
“The clotting system itself seems to be revved,” Landry said. “It’s not just inflamed blood vessels; it’s a hyper-coagulable state, so it would seem.”
Those blood clots are dangerous because they can easily choke off tiny blood vessels and impede the blood supply to parts of the body — lungs, kidneys, liver. However, the damage to those organs can confusingly manifest in other parts of the body. A failing kidney could mean less fluid is removed from the body, leading more fluid to accumulate in the lungs, worsening the respiratory symptoms of **Covid**-19, according to Landry.
The effects of organ damage can also linger and become permanent, even after the virus is eliminated. If a blood clot blocks a vessel leading to the heart, for example, it can cause the death of a section of heart muscle, a condition known as a myocardial infarction. “You could be surviving the pulmonary part but you could be dying of the cardiac part,” Landry said.
The ACE2 receptors are not just in blood vessels. They can be found in cells in the lungs, so SARS-CoV-2 may be directly causing respiratory symptoms like coughing as it damages those cells. Similarly, heart and kidney cells have this receptor and may be vulnerable to direct attack from the virus, potentially causing some of the observed cardiovascular symptoms.
So there are three potential sources of **Covid**-19 symptoms: the virus, the immune response to it, and the collateral damage from both. However, sorting out what damage is caused by which mechanism remains a challenge.
“That’s an open question as to what extent is it a primary cytotoxic effect from the virus infection, where it actually damages the cells it’s infecting, versus whether it’s damaging blood vessels,” Landry said. “That whole area needs to be investigated.”
By understanding the mechanisms of **Covid**-19, doctors can better anticipate the myriad ways it can present and come up with ways to counter its worst effects. But it will take yet more research to build this foundation.
The symptoms of **Covid**-19 may stick around for a long time
We’re now far enough into the pandemic that millions of people have recovered from **Covid**-19. While many are no longer contagious, some are finding that the illness has lasting effects on their health.
“For many people, the infection is not a self-limited condition,” Chan said. “Sometimes they’re left with longer-term symptoms that could be quite impairing.”
Already, recovered patients have reported ongoing coughing, trouble concentrating, and muscle weakness. Doctors have also found lesions on the hearts, lungs, and brains of **Covid**-19 patients that can take a long time to heal and may be permanent in some cases.
“Patients who have had terrible pneumonias or ARDS with **Covid**-19, are beginning to present now with syndromes of pulmonary fibrosis,” said Landry. “And this is really a grave lesion that can progress to end stage, requiring lung transplantation.”
Meanwhile, patients with brain damage can suffer lasting speech and mobility issues. **Covid**-19 survivors with heart damage can have persistent arrhythmias that can make it hard for them to conduct basic tasks. Diminished functions of organs like kidneys could progress and contribute to future health problems.
“There may be many more patients on hemodialysis in the future as a result of the severe damage they suffered to their kidney during the acute **Covid**-19 [pandemic],” Landry said.
And it’s not just people who fell severely ill who can suffer residual impacts. Even people who had a less severe course of the disease have reported long-lasting symptoms.
Taken together, the early findings about the long-term impacts of **Covid**-19 show that the world will likely be seeing signs of the illness for years to come — even if the virus were to vanish tomorrow. And in the coming months, even more symptoms and manifestations of the disease may yet emerge."
2020-05-20 10:43:19,newsmax.com,6.7175994,Right,Obesity Increases Odds of Lung Clots in COVID-19 Patients,"Obesity makes **COVID**-19 worse and may lead to deadly blood clots in the lungs, a new study finds.
The researchers said that obese patients with **COVID**-19 may have nearly three times the risk of developing what is known as a pulmonary embolism.
""Clinicians can utilize our findings to aid in determining which patients should have evaluation for pulmonary embolism with pulmonary CT angiography, as the symptoms for **COVID**-19 and pulmonary embolism overlap,"" said lead researcher Dr. Neo Poyiadi, from the department of diagnostic radiology at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.
""Early detection of pulmonary embolism can allow prompt treatment with anticoagulation and minimize clinical problems,"" he said.
Hospitalized obese patients with **COVID**-19 should be evaluated for increases in clotting indicated by a rising D-dimer — a blood test for clotting.
According to the study, 22% of 328 patients suffering from **COVID**-19 who had a CT scan angiography had a pulmonary embolism.
Researchers also found that patients taking statins to lower cholesterol before coming down with **COVID**-19 were less likely to have a pulmonary embolism.
""Further studies are needed to determine if statins have a protective effect against pulmonary embolism in **COVID**-19 patients,"" Poyiadi said.
Poyiadi added that a recent study suggests that **COVID**-19 patients should be placed on blood thinners to prevent clotting.
Obesity may make **COVID**-19 worse because it's associated with an increase in inflammation. Inflammation also increases the risk of clotting.
The report was published online May 14 in the journal Radiology.
Dr. Marc Siegel is a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. He said, ""This study underscores a point that's becoming more widely known about **COVID**-19 — that obesity leads to an inflammatory cascade. We know that inflammatory chemicals increase with obesity. That's the suspected mechanism of why obese patients are more at risk for complications.""
Inflammation can lead to blood clots, although that's not been proven, he noted.
""The complications of **COVID**-19 that we've been seeing are inflammation and a cytokine storm, which causes inflammation in the arteries and blood clots throughout the body — and obesity is a culprit in high-risk patients,"" Siegel said.
""To say that's why we're seeing more pulmonary embolism in obese patients is plausible. It's early small numbers, but it's a very important finding and it's not surprising,"" he said.
What is surprising is it looks like using statins might be helpful. Statins are anti-inflammatories, Siegel noted.
But whether statins are protective is something that would have to be carefully studied, he said. There's no clear-cut reason to start obese patients on statins if they weren't already taking them when they were admitted to the hospital, he added.
Obese patients with **COVID**-19 need the same care as other patients, Siegel said. That includes anticoagulation. Many of the complications of **COVID**-19 seem to be caused by clotting, and starting patients on blood thinners may become a standard treatment.
""We're already starting to look at preventative anticoagulation,"" he said. ""It's already something we're highly aware of, but this study adds evidence to a direct correlation between obesity and blood clots, that's what's new here."""

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released information which revealed that the vast majority of **COVID**-19 deaths were the result of underlying health conditions, called comorbidities.
President Trump tweeted out this information, which is directly stated on the CDC website, but Twitter took down the tweet, saying that it was false information.
According to CBS, Trump's retweet said that ""the CDC 'quietly updated the **Covid** number; to show a small fraction of all deaths — 6% — from the coronavirus were 'actually' a result of **COVID**-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The vast majority of deaths, the post claimed, were because of 'other serious illnesses.'""
Twitter took down the tweet, saying that is is ""no longer available because it violated the Twitter Rules.""
The CDC reported: ""Table 3 shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (**COVID**-19). For 6 [percent] of the deaths, **COVID**-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to **COVID**-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death. The number of deaths with each condition or cause is shown for all deaths and by age groups.""
This information was coupled with a graph that showed **COVID**-related deaths by age. The report also mentioned that of the 161,392 **COVID**-related deaths, a staggering 68,004 of them had influenza or pneumonia, and 54,803 suffered from respiratory failure.
Of the over 180,000 deaths attributed to **COVID**-19, six percent, or 9,683, were recorded on death certificates as having coronavirus as the sole cause of death. This was reported by the CDC on their website.
The United States has seen 6.1 million cased of **COVID**-19, and performs about a quarter million tests for every million people. To date, 187,248 deaths have been attributed to the virus, and there have been nearly 3.5 million recoveries."
